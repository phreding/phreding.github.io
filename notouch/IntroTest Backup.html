        <title>This is a Place Holder</title>
        <page id="intro">
            The year is 2175. The world is not the same place it is currently. A strangeness has taken oven the United States of America, to no ones surprise.

        <page id="wakeup" class="first">
            <p>The first thing you notice is that it is cold. You open yours eyes slowly and as the light streams into your retinas it begins a fire in your brain. You manage to pull yourself up slowly off of the cot you were laying on. You swing your feet over the edge and set your bare feet down onto the floor. Your feet are greeted by the soft touch of dirt. It sporadically covers the intricate tiling of the floor ingraining itself into the soft green tiles. Plants of every shape and size surround the perimeter of the room. They crawl up towards the walls and block out the windows casting their organic shadows all around.</p> 
            <p>You stand up slowly still not sure of where you are or even how you got there. As you try to remember anything past waking up two minutes ago a shock is sent through the base of your spine and an oozing warmth overcomes you.</p> 
            <p>There is only one door in the room. As you usher yourself through it, carefully of course you aren’t sure if anyone could be posed to attack, you come into a <show paragraph="churchlh">hallway</show> that stretches out in front of you. It is darkly lit and you can not see the end of it. To your right is a <turn to="churchroom">doorway.</turn> The door lies on the ground, broken and battered. In its place hangs soft blue silk draped over the door frame and obscuring the room from your view. Lastly, to your left is a rickety iron <turn to="churchstairs">staircase</turn> the spins into the ceiling and disappears beneath the floorboards of the upper floor.</p>   
            <paragraph id="churchlh">
                You carefully traverse the darken landscape taking one step at a time. Doors paper the walls and as you keep walking you notice them changing . Where you were sure the smallest was stands a large oak door. You blink for a moment and the hallway you have attempted to understand has rearranged itself once again. Your pace speeds up as you whisk towards what you hope is the end. You enter a large room filled with tables. An empty kitchen stands to your right. There is no one in slight. There is nothing interesting about this room. All the food is puréed anchovies. No one likes anchovies.

                A <interact with="bathtublady">woman</interact> stands over an old wooden bathtub. There seems to be a strange smell emanating from it. The water is a dark and murky blue color and often you see bubbles pop to the surface. The floor is cracked like a lighting bolt and from the crevice sprouts tiny sky blue saplings. The <turn to ="wakeup">doorway</turn> stands behind you

            <!--Upstairs--> 
        <page id="churchstairs">
                <p>You carefully ascend the stairs. The <turn to="wakeup">basement</turn> is left behind you. The whines of the steel swallow the sounds of your foot steps. As you emerge, light pours onto you warming your skin. The sun is a bright sword ever piercing into your soft retinas. It is liquid fire as the stained glass windows colour it red, orange, and yellow. Through the depicted pictures of wildflowers and mountains you get a distorted glance at the world outside. There is nothing to see.</p> 
                <p>Instead you turn your attention to the room you find yourself in currently. Fat comfortable sofas adorn the sides of the small chamber. They are untouched by the Ivy that crawls up the sides of the walls and bores through the ceiling. There is the soft sound of running water to your left as a trickling rivers sweeps through the industrialized floor and out into the blank expanse outside. Beyond the river,bleach stained bark of two great sycamore trees intertwine together to form an <turn to="chapel">arch</turn> saluting over the destroyed maroon carpet that protrudes from the floorboards. Dark blue fabric is interwoven between the melded wood and blows slightly in the breeze that drifts in from the open windows behind you.</p> 
                <p>A <interact with="churchlady">woman </interact> stands in the corner. Her frame is hunched over the burnt remains of a flower bed. Words shoot out of her mouth as she rocks back and forth over the ashes. A mass of sheer blue fabric is wrapped around her body. It covers everything from her neck down to her feet but you can see her knees digging into the crispy flowers as she carefully rakes her hands through the ash.</p> 
                <p>Past the woman is a <turn to="antiroom">small door</turn>. It’s tucked into the corner and if you weren’t attempting to gauge your surroundings your eyes would have certainly swept over it and focused on something more important. It’s be far the most metropolitan thing in the room even though it looks as if someone has attempted to paint a mountain landscape on the steel surface. The paint now peels back and reveals a sad, apocalyptic picture.</p> 
                <p>However standing directly in front of you is a grand set of <turn to="mainoffice">double doors</turn> adorned with sea glass that depict a woman standing in the center of a massive crowd.</p>

        <page id="antiroom">
                You sneak into the door. The light from the <turn to="churchstairs">main room</turn> shines in softly. The room is extremely small and smells like burnt flowers. On several brass hooks hang <interact with="bluerobes">dark blue robes</interact> and white shawls. There are a series of expensive looking candle holders as well as a basket of hand carved crosses.

The ceiling raises up seemingly forever and puncture the ceiling letting bullets of sunlight drift down to meet you. You see a dark red bird enter through a particularly large hole and take nest in a small sapling. Women are scattered around. Their faces are covered with white shawls and they mumble to themselves as they wash their hands in smaller bowls of water. Beyond them is the largest tree you have ever seen. Granted you haven't seen many trees since you woke up twenty minutes ago but it has to be pretty large because a

             <p>What you gaze out upon can’t even be called a city. The beautiful line of flickering metropolis buildings that stand off on the horizon could be called a city but the small area is surrounded by nothing but garbage. With gross, contagious, veins pulsating poverty through the slums that lay decaying on the edge of the desert sand it looks more like a decaying corpse than a city of wealth and prosperity. The strip of Neo-Vegas stands alone; it’s wealth is dwarfed by the pestilence that winds around it like a cobra, waiting to choke its life out. From the distance of the church, safely separated by miles of sand, you can’t see anything else except fro the stark contrast of buildings that shoot up out of the ground, and then the ones that don’t. Tabitha lays her hands on your shoulder as if to force your eyes upon the destruction.</p> 
             <p>“Ten Years. This is what can happen in Ten Years with a single death and a lot of bad leadership. Well, more like with no leadership at all.” Tabitha corrects herself. “There isn’t anything more contagious than panic when the Chairman of your city turns up randomly dead one day and there is no one you can point fingers at. There isn’t anything that falls apart faster than the systems of government.” You look away from the scene before you and over at Tabitha. Her wide eyes seem to be memorizing every detail of the city before her with meticulous care.</p> 
             <p>”Now we have a chance to make things right. To undo what we did. Some radicals want to get things moving again by unlocking the gridlocked council and get someone -- anyone, into the Chairman position. But, in order to that they have to dismantle the loyalist party that has stalled the council ever since the fall of the Chairman and want her useless brother to be installed to the position. Damien, said useless brother, is seeing a joint session of Council tomorrow to review his eligibility. The loyalists are pulling all the strings they have to get some of Neo-Vegas’ best and brightest to vie for his case.” Tabitha turns from her destroyed city and meanders back to her desk where she pulls an envelope from a desk drawer. She turns and hands it to you.</p>
             <p> “Inside this envelope contains all of the people who are detrimental to the election of Damien Moros. It’s paper. Virtually untraceable- unless of course you lose it. We need you to make sure they aren’t there. 
             That's the only way to restore Neo-Vegas back to even the shell of what to was. I’m not claiming that the city used to be a holy and but, it had to be better than this.” She gestures to the desolation rotting outside of the window. 
             <p>“I’m also not telling you to join us. <turn to="gameover">You can leave,</turn> but just know that there might not be a city to return to for much longer. So.” Tabitha asks. <show paragraph="Leave">"Are you with us?"</show></p>

                    <p>Daughter Euodia,</p>
                    <p>I am sorry for my absence from the church these past weeks. Tabitha has sent me to talk to the Brothers of the Isles and the Daughters of Job. They're all just as fearful as we are about the new rising that it taking place in downtown Neo-Vegas this month. With the ascension of the new chairmen everyone of the Abrahamic religions is more on edge than ever. In my meeting with the Daughters of Job they spoke of their connections with the Abu Lahab and their ranks have been dropping steadily for months now. All craving the ‘scientific release’ that Scientology will give them. I remember the stories Daughter Abel would tell us -- the ones about Abrahamic religions being powerful enough to control the government. What a sweet thought! Now we live by these rules,</p>
                    <p>Man is an immortal spiritual being.</p>
                    <p>His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.</p>
                    <p>His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.</p>
                    <p>How true those words are and how much I hate them for that truth. If I have learned anything from this life Euodia, is that man is a sick monster to those weaker than him. I myself have seen the things happening in the so called ‘safe houses’ on the strip. They are no more than the casinos that were gutted all those years ago. I can not wait to return to the safety of The Refuge and to your arms.</p>

                <p>[Except from a larger work on Neo-Vegas Religions]</p>
                 <p>The Church for the Children of Edith (CCE) is one of the newest factions to join the several Abrahamic practices since the major religions took a split in 2078 after the sudden rise of The Church of Scientology. The organisation was originally a branch of the Daughters of Job, but when Christelle Branwell became Honored Queen in 2103 she issued an armistice against the coal tycoon, Tyrell Veritch, and his company CONSOL Energy. A series of defectors formed an environmentalist movement dedicated to raise awareness of humanity's fragile balance with the Earth. One member was future CCE founder, Yutheria Retwell. </p> 
                 <p>The organizations scripture, “Dust to Dust” was in direct disagreement with Scientology’s beliefs of human immortality. The resisters fled to the city-state of Neo-Vegas where Yutheria Retwell established the Church for the Children of Edith as an institute for rehabilitating the Earth. The name came from Lot’s Wife who turned to salt after glancing back at the burning city of Sodom, according to current Eldest, Jones Mureel, it “...is a symbol that we are made from this Earth and to the Earth we shall return.”</p>

They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.  All go to one place.
