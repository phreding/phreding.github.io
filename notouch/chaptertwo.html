        <title>This is a Place Holder</title>
        <page id="intro">
            The year is 2175. 
        </page>
        <page id="levelone" class="first">
            <p>The Stratosphere Casino was the only triple A casino not located on the strip, however by not being located on the strip, it is the only casino within the actual city limits of Las Vegas. Notice the use to the past tense. During the fire of Las Vegas, the casino portion of what made up the Stratosphere Casino and Tower was transformed into what many refer to as a pile of hot nothing. The valley of ash formally known as the Stratosphere Casino sits under a complex of shopping centers called Mallvetica, as most of the funds came from the great-great-great-great granddaughter of Max Miedinger, the creator of the sweatpant font. </p>
            <p>The 1,129 foot tall tower however, was unfazed by the burning inferno that raged beneath it on that July night because after all <i> rocket fuel can’t burn steel beams. </i> </p>
            <p>Therefore the reinforced glass observatory that sits atop the tower managed to struggle through a fire, corporations, capitalistic greed and remain standing despite all gentrification odds. Even though it doesn't tower over the city anymore, it serves as a relic (and a bit of a reminder) of good times and years passed.</p>
            <p>Which is why it was given to the only person who could smear nostalgia in the dust.</p>
            <p>The woman in white was a legend; both because she was an academic genius and because many believed she didn’t exists. In a society where most are connected through a series of glass filament tubes shooting electrons that contain information, it was much easier to say that people who were very smarter than you were simply created by a group of people slightly smarter than you. This made people feel better about their own failed life goals and expectations. The woman in white was however, very really and therefore, a very large threat. </p>
            <p> Tabitha hadn’t given you much information about the woman in white, which could not be more evident by the fact you are referring to her as <i>the woman in white </i>. The name came from the entirely white attire she donned whenever she pried herself from the laboratory fashioned out of the observatory that now stood before you. From the white lab coat, to the high Victorian collar, right down to the velcro boots only someone with six doctorates could pull off. </p>
            <p> You are able to enter into the the base of the tower and ascend in the elevator with little difficulty. With the election a day closer, the higher citizens of the state have been flinging themselves into campaigns and the city has been quieter in person and exploding on the internet. The elevator drops you at the bottom of the observation deck and you step out into the <turn to="ReceptionArea">reception area</turn> to look for a way to get to the top floor.</p>
        </page>  
        <page id="ReceptionArea">
                <p>Reception desks. They have plagued the social anxious for decades. Not even the year 2175, with its high tech cakes and removal of library books, can stop the anxiety that arises in the pit of the stomachs of those who dread talking to other members of society.  For better or for worse, you haven’t decided, the lobby of Stratosphere Laboratories is empty. Completely, totally, and one hundred percent devoid of life. It’s a lifeless place in itself; after all, there are dead bodies sitting.. mmmmmm… twenty feet away from you fermenting in their own rotting atmosphere. </p>
                <p>The <interact with="DeskWIW">desk</interact> is organized in a sterile fashion that complements the pasty walls and white floor in a way no interior decoration ever could. The only thing that seems to be out of place is a single piece of <interact with="DeskNoteWIW"> paper</interact> that has the seams of crinkles running throughout it even though someone has obviously tried to flatten it out. Past the reception desk is a <turn to="HallwayWIW">hallway</turn> that seems to spread only deeper into the building. </p>
        </page>        
        <page id="HallwayWIW">
            The hallway is lit with fluorescent tubes called LED light bulbs. They were accidently invented in 1962 after some man just wanted to invent a laser. The man who owned incandescent light bulbs, aka the lightbulbs that were about to be replaced, felt a little peeved by this new and improved product and called it “the magic one”. Back in those days everything that wasn’t accepted by large corporations was damned and called ‘black magic’. Now, of course, corporations just steal their ideas and profit off of them. Underneath the black magic lightbulbs is a plain white <turn to="SupplyRoom">door</turn> that has the letter S-U-P-P-L-Y written across it. Therefore, you concur that it must be a supply closet. Directly across from the supply closet is a non descript <show paragraph="BoilerRoom">door</show>; all the doors are non descript as the woman in white doesn’t believe in signs, but this one is particularly bland. Further down the hallway is a sharp right <turn to ="BodyHolding">turn</turn> and from it wafts the terrible acidic stench of acids and flesh. Just before the turn seems to be a pair of pried open pair of silver <turn to="ElevatorOne">doors</turn>. The <turn to="ReceptionArea">lobby</turn> lurks behind you.

            <p>You approach door. It stares back at you in all of it’s non identifiable glory. You reach out to touch the door handle and are about to open the door when you hear a voice from within. </p>
            <p>“Babe, I didn’t know her. It was just a snapchat.” </p>
            <p>A snort of laughter follows.</p>
            <p>“Cameron do not change the group chat name to ‘David’s Fucked’. Just fix the boiler okay!”</p>

            You follow the stench of formaldehyde and decaying organic material, leaving behind the <turn to="HallwayWIW">hallway</turn>,  and enter into a long corridor room lined with black bags. Casements line the great corridor that stretched from only millimeters off the floor to unreachable heights and the thought of how those can even be used passes through your head. There is a large black sign painted on the floor in what seems to be futura. Futura is a font that used to be used by some people called the Nazi’s and was quite unpopular until another group of people, called astronauts, started to use it when they wanted some cool looking moon rocks. Both Nazi’s and astronauts hated the Russians. The large black signs says <show paragraph="Autopsy">autopsy</show> and points directly ahead of you.

        <paragraph id="Autopsy">
            <p>There are just straight up naked, dead, and dissected bodies. You aren’t quite sure what you expected. They sit around the circular subsection like a disturbed sort of meeting. </p>

            <p><i>You know, Hythem, I’m feeling pretty dead today.</i></p>
            <p>Or whatever the dead talk about these days. </p>
            <p>Shoved back, out of the way to make room for the dead, is a small doorway that reads <show paragraph="TempControlRoom">TEMP CONTROL</show> on a hastily made sign. </p>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="TempControlRoom">
            You cross the room, minding the precarious assembly of those passed on, and enter through the doorway. Passed the doorway is only a small room, matched in interior decor to the last. CyberTek computers are mounted on the south east wall, each displaying the national emblem of the Greater Plateau area. It spins and spins and spins around seeming to want your attention in the midst of a geopolitical crisis. Next to the congregation of computers is a <interact with="powerBox">power box.</interact> 
            that has seen better days. It seems to run on old tech - spark plugs. Those haven’t been used since the late 2060’s after Hannah Coliope created a nuclear powered battery shell that could run continuously for 567 years.  One spark plug seems to be missing.

                You leave the <turn to="HallwayWIW">hallway</turn> and approach the interior elevator. If Tabitha has told you correctly, this elevator should take you up the laboratory and into the upper offices where the woman in white works. Tabitha had said ‘lives’ but you gather that since her work is her life (she doesn’t have much of a home life to speak of.) The elevator doors are pried open with a metal bar of sorts and from the cranny a cold wind gusts up and washes around your feet.  There are tools precariously balanced on the edge of the elevator shaft as well. There is a hastily scrawled <interact with="ElevatorNote">note</interact> taped haphazardly on the side of the open crevice.

            <p>The doors click open with well oiled synchronicity and you gaze out onto what the old TV channel HGTV would call an ‘open floor plan’. Like the floors below you, and most likely like the floors above you, the laboratory that lounges in front of you is nothing but a white sterile landscape that seems to hold a plethora of scientific data. You feel like a test subject stepping into a test tube to be combined with Hydrochloric Acid and mention in an obscure medical paper. As you step out, probably contaminating the room with your less than sterile attire, you take in the four sections of the room. In the far right hand corner seems to be a durasteel door holding the entrance to a <turn to="vault">Black Box Room TM</turn> closed. To your <turn to="dataStorage">left</turn> are rows, and rows, and rows, of data processing units the hum quietly to themselves as they spin one and zeros into letters. Directly <show paragraph="labCounters">across</show> from you is a series of lab counters, each more complex than the last. Directly to your <turn to="chemStorage">right</turn> is what you think to be a chemical storage center. As above the door it reads.. WARNING CHEMICAL STORAGE. But these days, with these kinds of people, you never know. You also have the option to retreat into the elevator and <turn to="floorThreeWIW">ASCEND</turn> further.

            <p> The American Physiological Association classified petrichor as one of the most recognizable and influential smells stored in the human consciousness. The American Physiological Association failed to state why this was or why so many people enjoyed the aerosol of wet pavement shooting into their nostrils, but nevertheless, in the 2085 issue of <i>The Psychology Times</i> a twenty six page spread was published about iconic smells of the human race. Petrichor was the first, but Hydrochloric Acid was number three, (Crayola crayons stole the number two slot... curse those colorful bastards) which is what you get to smell when you enter into the chemical storage area, without proper safety equipment you might add.  This is truly the most dangerous thing you have done all day. The chemical safe free <turn to="floorTwoWIW">floor</turn> stands behind you.

            <p>The word hacker, like most technology, had its origins at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. M.I.T. was a university based in a town called Cambridge, which was in a state called Massachusetts, which was demolished when the United States of America was. The name hasn’t change in the hundred years since the fall however. There, in the minutes of an university honoring a dead geographical location, on April 1955 in the meeting of the Tech Model Railroad Club states, “Mr. Eccles requests anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn these power off to avoid blowing a fuse.” The term ‘hacker’ was used by computer enthusiast to describe computer programs. The term as we know it, which means, “A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information through electronic means.” originated in the work, <i>cracker</i>. </p>

You imagine that the red blinking of the lights through the, of course, pristine glass means that whatever the woman in white has storage in the ones and zeros being process she has protected against the crackers. You move down the aisles, further from the <turn to="floorTwoWIW">door</turn>, of the black computers; all whirling trillions upon trillions of data. The voice from the part of your brain that is still a child provides conversations as if the brittle boxes were old spinsters making their lively hoods with the treads the wove. </p>

Three guesses at which one the woman in white was. She was the unmentioned third option because she didn't believe in pencils. This was a paperless place. Ride or Die technology. You run your hand delicately over the counter tops that hold a smorgasbord of experiments that will probably improve the quality of life for millions of people over the course of the next couple decades. You won’t lie, the amount of passion one woman has managed to poor into the progression of the human nation floors you to some extent. Though one must weigh the costs.

                <p>Serum #164 has yielded positive results in creating stagnant activity in patients neurological synapses. The TCA scan of 22 January 2175 results in the decrease of 10 billion neurons in the brain causing the patient to result to ‘muscle memory’ activities only. It can be very effective in rendering a person to a most basic, vegetable like, useless basically, state. When paired with Serum #654 there is a high possibility of combating against the 'mind erasure' currently taking place in the meatpacking district. Over the course of the past six months, over twenty individuals have disappeared and been found with synthetic amnesia. </p>

                <p> As soon as the elevator arrives at the third floor a terrible stench floats from the previously closed off section and into the elevator, an elevator which seems to have stopped once again. This time just one floor short your intended target. You try not to see a morbid metaphor in that. You manage to push yourself out of the broken container and into the sickening mist of formaldehyde that leisurely drapes itself across the room. Said room that you have just entered, is the black sheep of Stratosphere Laboratories.  If the other floors were the perfect children this would be the one that depression went undiagnosed and now sell cocaine for a living. Depression is a disease that is called when the bad chemicals in your brain start working too much. Cocaine is a white powdery substance that looks like powdered sugar; both can make people addicted to it. The first thing brought to your attention is just how dark this room is compared to the others. While the lower levels where almost blindingly lit with flourescent lightbulbs, level three seems to being more partial to having what 20th century teenagers called a <i>rave</i>. The illumination that was supposed to be coming from the ceiling now seemed to expresses itself from all around as the lights seemed insistent on having a strobe effect.</p>
                <p>You take a step further out, and as you do so your foot lands in a sticky substance that coats the bottom of your boot. You cast your attention downwards and see that you are standing in a thin pool of liquid. As you take another, more careful, step forward you see the ripples shatter throughout the floor and continue on until the hit the far wall before boomeranging back to you. </p> 
                <p>Fat coils of wire drape from the ceiling, all haphazardly pulled out of the tiles, making a cascading river of electrons  that cut canyons down the walls. They all seem to flow to four separate… four individual… four circular…. tanks? Your brain only seems to recognize the cylindrical objects that dominate the majority of the putrid room as over sized fish tanks. A gelatinous fluid sloshes around, being propelled by something that is coming out of the plethora of wires that sucker themselves to the bottom of each tank. The image could be compared to that of a synthetic octopus, if there were any octopuses left for it to be compared to that is. </p>

The first tank seems to empty, drained of both experiments and the putrid jelly that seems to be coating the floor in a news type of carpet that should never have been invented. Another thing that should never have been invented, Red Dye No. 2. Don’t know why, but everyone seems to hate it. You circle the tank looking for signs that might lead you to understanding the decomposing scene before you, Your hunt ends you to finding one of the lab assistants, or what you assume to be a lab assistant, in this economy, you never know. He is slouched against the tank, breathing still, most likely just passed out due to the horrid stench that even now makes you queasy, his body congealing in the thick liquid.

                The second tank seems to have a series of… abstract figures preserved in the formaldehyde that slowly churns within. As the blades of air spin the mixture around, a severed hand pass you by, waving through the window. You tear your eyes away from it as it passes around to the other side of the tank and look down to see a <interact with="tankTwoBody">body</interact> curled up around the base of the tank. You freeze as you realize they are conscious, but just barely. The only motor function they seem capable of is muttering incoherently to themselves.

                The third tank seems to be the oldest of the two. The plexiglass is now tainted with scratches and spiderweb fractures and the formaldehyde inside looks as if to have reached new levels of fermentation. The usually clear   liquid has become a terrible red colour that can obscure your vision to the other side, but just isn't dark enough to hide the human shaped figure inside. A study conducted in 2089 revealed that the human silhouette dropped thirteen slots in the most recognizable figure after John Risch developed Bamme, a corporation dedicated to changing the human form to the mind’s whim.

The most similar synonym listed is broken while wiped out is the least. If one were to visit www.dictionary.com/browse/destroyed they would find that the origin of the word destroyed cones from the Middle English word ‘destroyen’ which comes from the Old French word ‘desturire,’ which comes from the Vulgar Latin word ‘destrugere’, which comes from the Basic Latin word destruere; which means “to pick up, build”.  Ironic how that works. Yet, despite all of the synonyms listed on www.thesaurus.com/browse/destoryed, there fails to be one that can describe the type of destruction that has taken place here.

Floor two makes that look like freaking Buckingham Palace. Something happened to one of the tanks and now the Shifta gel is everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Some of it even got into the circuit room and now the power is wiggin’ out. I think we can kill two jobs with one switch if we re-route the power from the ceiling coils to the electrical grid in the floor. The heat should evaporate some of that Shifa and the power should be working fine. Just throw the left switch in the circuit room and make sure no one’s on the floor when you do it? Formaldehyde might be a bad smell but I’m sure charred flesh is worse. </p>

                <p>The building that once held so much life and gambling is now a white, sterile, medical facility at it’s heart. The woman in white stands against the wall of windows that encompasses the laboratory, a coal black backdrop framing her silhouette against the city skyline. Printed over the windows, in letters that not even the blind could miss are the words.</p>

The woman who towers over Neo-Vegas, both figuratively - and now quite literally, must be aware of your presence by now; for as you cross the circular room you are doing nothing to block the sound wave that echo from your feet and the woman before you is not hard of hearing. Her eyes register the sound waves that are pushed from the floor, those vibrations are converted into messages in the brain which fire synapses that alerted her to your presence.</p>

                <p>“What does it matter if you kill me or not?” She moves towards the desk that sits just behind her and retrieves something, but does not look at you. “You have already made that decision hundreds of times already. Whom am I but one more body to hit the floor? My life counts as no more than the guards downstairs.” She turns back to face the window now. A new, sudden, disposition about her. “We had the chance to push humanity forward from the ashes of complete and utter failure. I was prepared to do what needed to be done to make that happen, it is none of my concern that others weren’t. The fact of the matter is sometimes the uncivilized things have to go.</p>

                She throws a glance over her shoulder, as if that’s all you deserve. “We set out to progress humanity; we never said it would be a moral movement. These radicals you no doubt work for tell you that we are nothing better than tyrants, but look around you. The quality of life is improving exponentially before our eyes! People are living longer, being healthier, the global poverty rate is declining, child mortality is at an all time low, the planet has stopped heating, and for Cruise’s sake people are richer now than they have ever been.

Your claim about the woman in white being hard of hearing is surely false now. The glass windows that surround the laboratory shatter inward, firing glass bullets into the room. Your eyes water from the pain of it all but you manage to keep yourself upright and look the woman dead in the eye. “And I am forth and willing to die as well.” And with no more words, the wind reaches up from the skyline below and grabs her pulling her towards the sidewalk.

                <p>For reason unclear - when subjects 2A through 2D are injected with the same carbon based serum, the pulmonary artery swells to a size of 3.4 cm and makes the subject unable to pass oxygenated blood through the system. This leads to either total organ failure (78 of 155 patients) or to asphyxiation (55 of 122 patients). Depending on the method of injection, the time of swelling begins at 4.34 seconds if injected into the jugular artery or 5.89 seconds in injected into the femoral artery.  More conclusive date will be needed for shipment and launch of Minaji. </p>
