        <title>This is a Place Holder</title>
        <page id="intro">
            The year is 2175. The world is not the same place it is currently. A strangeness has taken oven the United States of America, to no ones surprise.
        </page>
        <page id="wakeup" class="first">
            <p>The first thing you notice is that it is cold. You open yours eyes slowly and as the light streams into your retinas it begins a fire in your brain. You manage to pull yourself up slowly off of the cot you were laying on. You swing your feet over the edge and set your bare feet down onto the floor. Your feet are greeted by the soft touch of dirt. It sporadically covers the intricate tiling of the floor ingraining itself into the soft green tiles. Plants of every shape and size surround the perimeter of the room. They crawl up towards the walls and block out the windows casting their organic shadows all around.</p> 
            <p>You stand up slowly still not sure of where you are or even how you got there. As you try to remember anything past waking up two minutes ago a shock is sent through the base of your spine and an oozing warmth overcomes you.</p> 
            <p>There is only one door in the room. As you usher yourself through it, carefully of course you aren’t sure if anyone could be posed to attack, you come into a <show paragraph="churchlh">hallway</show> that stretches out in front of you. It is darkly lit and you can not see the end of it. To your right is a <turn to="churchroom">doorway.</turn> The door lies on the ground, broken and battered. In its place hangs soft blue silk draped over the door frame and obscuring the room from your view. Lastly, to your left is a rickety iron <turn to="churchstairs">staircase</turn> the spins into the ceiling and disappears beneath the floorboards of the upper floor.</p>   
            <paragraph id="churchlh">
                You carefully traverse the darken landscape taking one step at a time. Doors paper the walls and as you keep walking you notice them changing . Where you were sure the smallest was stands a large oak door. You blink for a moment and the hallway you have attempted to understand has rearranged itself once again. Your pace speeds up as you whisk towards what you hope is the end. You enter a large room filled with tables. An empty kitchen stands to your right. There is no one in slight. There is nothing interesting about this room. All the food is puréed anchovies. No one likes anchovies.

        <page id="churchroom">
                A <interact with="bathtublady">woman</interact> stands over an old wooden bathtub. There seems to be a strange smell emanating from it. The water is a dark and murky blue color and often you see bubbles pop to the surface. The floor is cracked like a lighting bolt and from the crevice sprouts tiny sky blue saplings. The <turn to ="wakeup">doorway</turn> stands behind you  
        </page>        
            <!--Upstairs--> 
        <page id="churchstairs">
                <p>You carefully ascend the stairs. The <turn to="wakeup">basement</turn> is left behind you. The whines of the steel swallow the sounds of your foot steps. As you emerge, light pours onto you warming your skin. The sun is a bright sword ever piercing into your soft retinas. It is liquid fire as the stained glass windows colour it red, orange, and yellow. Through the depicted pictures of wildflowers and mountains you get a distorted glance at the world outside. There is nothing to see.</p> 
                <p>Instead you turn your attention to the room you find yourself in currently. Fat comfortable sofas adorn the sides of the small chamber. They are untouched by the Ivy that crawls up the sides of the walls and bores through the ceiling. There is the soft sound of running water to your left as a trickling rivers sweeps through the industrialized floor and out into the blank expanse outside. Beyond the river,bleach stained bark of two great sycamore trees intertwine together to form an <turn to="chapel">arch</turn> saluting over the destroyed maroon carpet that protrudes from the floorboards. Dark blue fabric is interwoven between the melded wood and blows slightly in the breeze that drifts in from the open windows behind you.</p> 
                <p>A <interact with="churchlady">woman </interact> stands in the corner. Her frame is hunched over the burnt remains of a flower bed. Words shoot out of her mouth as she rocks back and forth over the ashes. A mass of sheer blue fabric is wrapped around her body. It covers everything from her neck down to her feet but you can see her knees digging into the crispy flowers as she carefully rakes her hands through the ash.</p> 
                <p>Past the woman is a <turn to="antiroom">small door</turn>. It’s tucked into the corner and if you weren’t attempting to gauge your surroundings your eyes would have certainly swept over it and focused on something more important. It’s be far the most metropolitan thing in the room even though it looks as if someone has attempted to paint a mountain landscape on the steel surface. The paint now peels back and reveals a sad, apocalyptic picture.</p> 
                <p>However standing directly in front of you is a grand set of <turn to="mainoffice">double doors</turn> adorned with sea glass that depict a woman standing in the center of a massive crowd.</p> 
        </page>
        <page id="antiroom">
                You sneak into the door. The light from the <turn to="churchstairs">main room</turn> shines in softly. The room is extremely small and smells like burnt flowers. On several brass hooks hang <interact with="bluerobes">dark blue robes</interact> and white shawls. There are a series of expensive looking candle holders as well as a basket of hand carved crosses.

            The room is large. <turn to="churchstairs">The door stands behind you.</turn> Trees rise up from broken floor boards and set themselves into a circular fashion around a fountain that sinks into the centre of the floor. The ceiling raises up seemingly forever and puncture the ceiling letting bullets of sunlight drift down to meet you. You see a dark red bird enter through a particularly large hole and take nest in a small sapling. Women are scattered around. Their faces are covered with white shawls and they mumble to themselves as they wash their hands in smaller bowls of water. Beyond them is the largest tree you have ever seen. Granted you haven't seen many trees since you woke up twenty minutes ago but it has to be pretty large because a

			<p>You find yourself standing in front of a building, but building is the wrong word to describe the figure that towers before you. It is a monument of power, built on the ashes of an ancient metropolitan city. The Cosmopolitan Casino, which stretches up one hundred and four floors, has the capacity to hold close to twenty four thousand people. People around you flock to the giant black block of a building like pilgrims used to flock to Mecca. You recall the layout of the building, as told to you by Tabatha quickly as she thrust a sword into your hand. It has six pools including a daytime pool, a nighttime pool, and a relaxation pool. There is an art gallery on the fifty second floor currently featuring video screenings of classical performance artist Marina Abramovic. The lower floors contain signature attractions such as Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub. Both were part of the original Cosmopolitan Casino that was demolished in 2150. There wasn’t much there to demolish in the first place because everything was mostly burned down but that didn’t stop the contractors from rolling in and making sure that the rest of the buildings went to rubble. No stone left behind, or something like that. </p>
			<p>Despite all the amenities that the Cosmopolitan has to offer, it is most famous for selling its customers something that can’t be bought on the shelves of the Save-n-Shop that has taken over every street corner. The Cosmopolitan has managed to mass product the sale of lust. It was quite easy to do once Naomi Hall was able to liquefy hormones into injectable capsules. EM-O-TION was now one of the leading synthetic companies with stock up over 3 points in the last week alone.</p> 
			<p>But you aren’t hear for Naomi Hall and her synthetic empire. You are here for the man that lives on the top floor of this edifice. Nickolev Zakharov is the son of one of the founding members of Neo Vegas. When The Great Fire of Las Vegas destroyed 100 square miles of downtown Las Vegas Nickolev’s father Yakoev, was the main architect and technology expert to design the new strip for the city of Las Vegas. All of the pulsating electric lights, from the Margent Corp Building and the thousands of men handling the finances for Great Basin bioregion right down to the Neo-Vegas Public library and the thousands of books that reside within its glass frame came from Yakoev’s mind.</p>  
			<p>You only know the facts of your mission target. Nickolev went studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. He returned only when his father passed away and now he rules over an empire built on the image of societal beauty. He is the main benefactor from the faction going up agaisnt But the man inside of the all black suit is a mystery to everyone else as he is to you -- someone who first heard his name four hours ago. </p>
			<p>Even though it is a cloudless night, you can just barely see the electric blue kool-aid lights from the private terraces that signifies elite presence at the <turn to="outerAtrium">cosmopolitan.</turn> </p>
        </page>
		<page id="outerAtrium">
			<p>You enter into the crescent par-thru of the Cosmopolitan's outer atrium. The solar roadways have been tinted black to match the facade of the building. Par-transports pull up, their sleek white exteriors hum softly as the richest citizens in step into the soft blue glow of the <turn to="interiorA">interior</turn>.</p>
			<p>You look around a little more glancing further out, past the Cosmo grounds and into the busy street of the Neo-Vegas strip. Pars- transports stream past, each following their specific route, gracefully interweaving throughout eachother. Above them the endless black sky is a plain backdrop to the fluorescent lights screaming to be read. </p>

			<p><i>Unlock your full potential -- Join Scientology Today!</i></p>
			<p><i>McDonald's Little Triple Big Wrap is BACK.</i></p>
			<p>Somethings last the test of time, you guess.</p>
			<p>Behind you you stands an intricate looking <turn to="fountain">fountain.</turn> It must have been an Old-Vegas relic saved from the Great Fire by somebody on the hotel staff. The marble structure almost radiates Statehood times with it’s smooth white curves and small cherubs adorning the obelisk that slowly pours out actual water. Opposite the crowded street you get a glimpse of an Oxidizer. It has been custom fitted to match the aesthetic of the building but the tell tale signs of oxygen junkies surrounding it give away it’s purpose. An invention by Great Basin native, Norman Beller no doubt. His inventions have taken the region by storm for replacing natural processes. Speaking of natural processes, you notice a very small sign tucked into the back left hand corner of the par-thru that reads, <turn to="garden">Memorial Gardens.</turn></p>

			<p>You take a seat on the smooth surface of the fountain and it immediately sends coldness up your spine that is soothing against the dry hot air.  You gaze are the <turn to="outerAtrium">outer atrium.</turn> Why not enjoy the institute you plan to dismantle?

You can no longer see the street from here as you walk deeper into the garden. The turf under you is soft, a softness that can only be produced by Fabric Herb™. Another invention to lower the dependency on the environment produced by Norman Beller.

                <p>Yakoev Zarkharov was not only responsible for the restoration of the greater Neo-Vegas area he was also a respected veteran in the Greater North America Militant Siege, where he served as a technological advisor to the States. When the United States government was disbanded after the defeat of the Militants by the States, Yakoev was appointed to serve as a technological strategist on the North American Development Committee of Ecoregions. Yakoev spent three years in Laurentia where he met his wife Sletvana. After the implementation of bioregional government over the destroyed United States and Canada, Yakoev moved to Great Basin where he had his first and only child, Nickolev. Sletvana passed away in childbirth due to a reaction to the drug Lempthphorin. Yakoev continued to be a beacon of advancement as he continued to build the Cosmopolitan in wake of the tragedy. He leaves behind a legacy of innovation in the face of destruction and perseverance when no hope was seen.  May the Cosmopolitan Casino before you stand as a mausoleum to an irreplaceable architect.</p>

             <p>What you gaze out upon can’t even be called a city. The beautiful line of flickering metropolis buildings that stand off on the horizon could be called a city but the small area is surrounded by nothing but garbage. With gross, contagious, veins pulsating poverty through the slums that lay decaying on the edge of the desert sand it looks more like a decaying corpse than a city of wealth and prosperity. The strip of Neo-Vegas stands alone; it’s wealth is dwarfed by the pestilence that winds around it like a cobra, waiting to choke its life out. From the distance of the church, safely separated by miles of sand, you can’t see anything else except fro the stark contrast of buildings that shoot up out of the ground, and then the ones that don’t. Tabitha lays her hands on your shoulder as if to force your eyes upon the destruction.</p> 
             <p>“Ten Years. This is what can happen in Ten Years with a single death and a lot of bad leadership. Well, more like with no leadership at all.” Tabitha corrects herself. “There isn’t anything more contagious than panic when the Chairman of your city turns up randomly dead one day and there is no one you can point fingers at. There isn’t anything that falls apart faster than the systems of government.” You look away from the scene before you and over at Tabitha. Her wide eyes seem to be memorizing every detail of the city before her with meticulous care.</p> 
             <p>”Now we have a chance to make things right. To undo what we did. Some radicals want to get things moving again by unlocking the gridlocked council and get someone -- anyone, into the Chairman position. But, in order to that they have to dismantle the loyalist party that has stalled the council ever since the fall of the Chairman and want her useless brother to be installed to the position. Damien, said useless brother, is seeing a joint session of Council tomorrow to review his eligibility. The loyalists are pulling all the strings they have to get some of Neo-Vegas’ best and brightest to vie for his case.” Tabitha turns from her destroyed city and meanders back to her desk where she pulls an envelope from a desk drawer. She turns and hands it to you.</p>
             <p> “Inside this envelope contains all of the people who are detrimental to the election of Damien Moros. It’s paper. Virtually untraceable- unless of course you lose it. We need you to make sure they aren’t there. 
             That's the only way to restore Neo-Vegas back to even the shell of what to was. I’m not claiming that the city used to be a holy and but, it had to be better than this.” She gestures to the desolation rotting outside of the window. 
             <p>“I’m also not telling you to join us. <turn to="gameover">You can leave,</turn> but just know that there might not be a city to return to for much longer. So.” Tabitha asks. <show paragraph="Leave">"Are you with us?"</show></p>

                    <p>Daughter Euodia,</p>
                    <p>I am sorry for my absence from the church these past weeks. Tabitha has sent me to talk to the Brothers of the Isles and the Daughters of Job. They're all just as fearful as we are about the new rising that it taking place in downtown Neo-Vegas this month. With the ascension of the new chairmen everyone of the Abrahamic religions is more on edge than ever. In my meeting with the Daughters of Job they spoke of their connections with the Abu Lahab and their ranks have been dropping steadily for months now. All craving the ‘scientific release’ that Scientology will give them. I remember the stories Daughter Abel would tell us -- the ones about Abrahamic religions being powerful enough to control the government. What a sweet thought! Now we live by these rules,</p>
                    <p>Man is an immortal spiritual being.</p>
                    <p>His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.</p>
                    <p>His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.</p>
                    <p>How true those words are and how much I hate them for that truth. If I have learned anything from this life Euodia, is that man is a sick monster to those weaker than him. I myself have seen the things happening in the so called ‘safe houses’ on the strip. They are no more than the casinos that were gutted all those years ago. I can not wait to return to the safety of The Refuge and to your arms.</p>

                <p>[Except from a larger work on Neo-Vegas Religions]</p>
                 <p>The Church for the Children of Edith (CCE) is one of the newest factions to join the several Abrahamic practices since the major religions took a split in 2078 after the sudden rise of The Church of Scientology. The organisation was originally a branch of the Daughters of Job, but when Christelle Branwell became Honored Queen in 2103 she issued an armistice against the coal tycoon, Tyrell Veritch, and his company CONSOL Energy. A series of defectors formed an environmentalist movement dedicated to raise awareness of humanity's fragile balance with the Earth. One member was future CCE founder, Yutheria Retwell. </p> 
                 <p>The organizations scripture, “Dust to Dust” was in direct disagreement with Scientology’s beliefs of human immortality. The resisters fled to the city-state of Neo-Vegas where Yutheria Retwell established the Church for the Children of Edith as an institute for rehabilitating the Earth. The name came from Lot’s Wife who turned to salt after glancing back at the burning city of Sodom, according to current Eldest, Jones Mureel, it “...is a symbol that we are made from this Earth and to the Earth we shall return.”</p>

                <p>Remember these phrases Daughter Easter.“We came from this Earth and to the Earth we will return.” Let those words guide your actions.</p>
                <p>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. -- Gen 3:19</p>
                <p>Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, -- Gen 18:27</p>
                <p>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.  All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return” but the difference is that “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work” -- Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</p>
                <p>Therefore I retract, And I repent in dust and ashes.”--Job 42:6</p>

                       “Oh!” The woman says pulling he hands out of the tub. They are stained with the dark substance but she wipes them off on here even darker skirt and move towards you. “ I see you're finally up! That’s such good news!” She grabs your hand and shakes it rigorously. “I’m Zipporah. We’ve been anxiously awaiting your awakening."

                       “Oh goodness! I am so ever terribly sorry.” The woman says, “I bet you are just full of questions. Well you see--” She stops suddenly and the pleasant maternal smile falls from her face. “You know what? You better have Tabitha explain. She’s in the offices upstairs when you’re ready. Here take this map.” Then without another word she goes back to her bathtub and silently stirs it.

                    You walk over to her slowly. You can see that her hands are stained with a deep black oil. It is the same substance that is smeared across her eyes creating a black bar from temple to temple. Her eyes dart up to meet you.“You shouldn’t be so loud daughter. Your footsteps keeps life in the ground. Should you go into the chapel,” she pauses and taps the shell of her ear, “remember that Joanna hears all in God’s Earth.” She continues to sift through her destroyed flower bed.

                    <p>You an unsure what how to disturb the woman from her work. You decide to just awkwardly walk forward until you are looming over her curled form. This makes you feel very awkward so you cough lightly. The woman doesn't move. You cough again</p>
                    <p>"Please stop coughing. You'll get my plants sick. They aren't used to foreign bacteria." She says every single syllable of her words laced with an uncaring attitude. The silence stretches on only permeated by the soft friction of her pen against a piece of paper. </p>
                    <p>“I bet there are a lot of questions you want to ask me.” The woman says still not looking up. You don’t answer her question just stand there, lips closed tight. She continues anyway, “Waking up in a place with no memory to speak of, no one trying to promise you you're safe.” Setting her pen down the woman finally turns her face up to meet yours. Her face, like the entire building, is smeared with dirt and the telltale signs of black smeared across her eyes mark her as a member of the church. “Creates a lot of question.” She says it factually without any doubt in her voice. “But the fact is I won’t be able to answer any of them. You are as much of a mystery to me as you are to yourself.” The sigh that comes out of her mouth seems to exhaust even you.</p>
                    <p>“Here is what I know. You have an incredible set of skills that could be useful in restoring order to Neo-Vegas. One that we could really use.”</p>

Her chair creaks as she leans back and she gives you a once over, eyes scanning top to bottom. "You then proceeded to walk into the crowd and disappear. Daughter Eve found you unconscious in a dumpster behind a bar on Promenade Ave."

Current director of the Neo-Vegas division of The Church of the Children of Edith, if that makes any difference on your decision.” You shake her hand and some of the dirt come off onto your skin. This bothers you for some reason. “So. Would you like to be apart of a revolution?”</p>
                    <p>You remain silent.</p>
                    <p>“Come. Look.” Tabitha says coming out from behind her desk.  She walks over and rips aside a pair of rotting brown curtains. Light shoots into the room from the outside world from the first un stained glass window you’ve seen in your time here - wherever that is. “This might encourage your...view” She says jerking her head. “It isn’t going anywhere.” You stand up cautiously and walk over to <turn to="windowmono">the light.</turn></p>
