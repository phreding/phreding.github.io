        <title>This is an Interregnum</title>
        <page id="intro">
            The year is 2175. The world is not the same place it is currently. A strangeness has taken oven the United States of America, to no ones surprise.

        <page id="wakeup" class="first">
            <p>The first thing you notice is that it is cold. You open yours eyes slowly and as the light streams into your retinas it begins a fire in your brain. You manage to pull yourself up slowly off of the cot you were laying on. You swing your feet over the edge and set your bare feet down onto the floor. Your feet are greeted by the soft touch of dirt. It sporadically covers the intricate tiling of the floor ingraining itself into the soft green tiles. Plants of every shape and size surround the perimeter of the room. They crawl up towards the walls and block out the windows casting their organic shadows all around.</p> 
            <p>You stand up slowly still not sure of where you are or even how you got there. As you try to remember anything past waking up two minutes ago a shock is sent through the base of your spine and an oozing warmth overcomes you.</p> 
            <p>There is only one door in the room. As you usher yourself through it, carefully of course you aren’t sure if anyone could be posed to attack, you come into a <show paragraph="churchlh">hallway</show> that stretches out in front of you. It is darkly lit and you can not see the end of it. To your right is a <turn to="churchroom">doorway.</turn> The door lies on the ground, broken and battered. In its place hangs soft blue silk draped over the door frame and obscuring the room from your view. Lastly, to your left is a rickety iron <turn to="churchstairs">staircase</turn> the spins into the ceiling and disappears beneath the floorboards of the upper floor.</p>   
            <paragraph id="churchlh">
                You carefully traverse the darken landscape taking one step at a time. Doors paper the walls and as you keep walking you notice them changing . Where you were sure the smallest was stands a large oak door. You blink for a moment and the hallway you have attempted to understand has rearranged itself once again. Your pace speeds up as you whisk towards what you hope is the end. You enter a large room filled with tables. An empty kitchen stands to your right. There is no one in slight. There is nothing interesting about this room. All the food is puréed anchovies. No one likes anchovies.

                A <interact with="bathtublady">woman</interact> stands over an old wooden bathtub. There seems to be a strange smell emanating from it. The water is a dark and murky blue color and often you see bubbles pop to the surface. The floor is cracked like a lighting bolt and from the crevice sprouts tiny sky blue saplings. The <turn to ="wakeup">doorway</turn> stands behind you

            <!--Upstairs--> 
        <page id="churchstairs">
                <p>You carefully ascend the stairs. The <turn to="wakeup">basement</turn> is left behind you. The whines of the steel swallow the sounds of your foot steps. As you emerge, light pours onto you warming your skin. The sun is a bright sword ever piercing into your soft retinas. It is liquid fire as the stained glass windows colour it red, orange, and yellow. Through the depicted pictures of wildflowers and mountains you get a distorted glance at the world outside. There is nothing to see.</p> 
                <p>Instead you turn your attention to the room you find yourself in currently. Fat comfortable sofas adorn the sides of the small chamber. They are untouched by the Ivy that crawls up the sides of the walls and bores through the ceiling. There is the soft sound of running water to your left as a trickling rivers sweeps through the industrialized floor and out into the blank expanse outside. Beyond the river,bleach stained bark of two great sycamore trees intertwine together to form an <turn to="chapel">arch</turn> saluting over the destroyed maroon carpet that protrudes from the floorboards. Dark blue fabric is interwoven between the melded wood and blows slightly in the breeze that drifts in from the open windows behind you.</p> 
                <p>A <interact with="churchlady">woman </interact> stands in the corner. Her frame is hunched over the burnt remains of a flower bed. Words shoot out of her mouth as she rocks back and forth over the ashes. A mass of sheer blue fabric is wrapped around her body. It covers everything from her neck down to her feet but you can see her knees digging into the crispy flowers as she carefully rakes her hands through the ash.</p> 
                <p>Past the woman is a <turn to="antiroom">small door</turn>. It’s tucked into the corner and if you weren’t attempting to gauge your surroundings your eyes would have certainly swept over it and focused on something more important. It’s be far the most metropolitan thing in the room even though it looks as if someone has attempted to paint a mountain landscape on the steel surface. The paint now peels back and reveals a sad, apocalyptic picture.</p> 
                <p>However standing directly in front of you is a grand set of <turn to="mainoffice">double doors</turn> adorned with sea glass that depict a woman standing in the center of a massive crowd.</p> 
        </page>
        <page id="antiroom">
                You sneak into the door. The light from the <turn to="churchstairs">main room</turn> shines in softly. The room is extremely small and smells like burnt flowers. On several brass hooks hang <interact with="bluerobes">dark blue robes</interact> and white shawls. There are a series of expensive looking candle holders as well as a basket of hand carved crosses.

            The room is large. <turn to="churchstairs">The door stands behind you.</turn> Trees rise up from broken floor boards and set themselves into a circular fashion around a fountain that sinks into the centre of the floor. The ceiling raises up seemingly forever and puncture the ceiling letting bullets of sunlight drift down to meet you. You see a dark red bird enter through a particularly large hole and take nest in a small sapling. Women are scattered around. Their faces are covered with white shawls and they mumble to themselves as they wash their hands in smaller bowls of water. Beyond them is the largest tree you have ever seen. Granted you haven't seen many trees since you woke up twenty minutes ago but it has to be pretty large because a

             <p>What you gaze out upon can’t even be called a city. The beautiful line of flickering metropolis buildings that stand off on the horizon could be called a city but the small area is surrounded by nothing but garbage. With gross, contagious, veins pulsating poverty through the slums that lay decaying on the edge of the desert sand it looks more like a decaying corpse than a city of wealth and prosperity. The strip of Neo-Vegas stands alone; it’s wealth is dwarfed by the pestilence that winds around it like a cobra, waiting to choke its life out. From the distance of the church, safely separated by miles of sand, you can’t see anything else except fro the stark contrast of buildings that shoot up out of the ground, and then the ones that don’t. Tabitha lays her hands on your shoulder as if to force your eyes upon the destruction.</p> 
             <p>“Ten Years. This is what can happen in Ten Years with a single death and a lot of bad leadership. Well, more like with no leadership at all.” Tabitha corrects herself. “There isn’t anything more contagious than panic when the Chairman of your city turns up randomly dead one day and there is no one you can point fingers at. There isn’t anything that falls apart faster than the systems of government.” You look away from the scene before you and over at Tabitha. Her wide eyes seem to be memorizing every detail of the city before her with meticulous care.</p> 
             <p>”Now we have a chance to make things right. To undo what we did. Some radicals want to get things moving again by unlocking the gridlocked council and get someone -- anyone, into the Chairman position. But, in order to that they have to dismantle the loyalist party that has stalled the council ever since the fall of the Chairman and want her useless brother to be installed to the position. Damien, said useless brother, is seeing a joint session of Council tomorrow to review his eligibility. The loyalists are pulling all the strings they have to get some of Neo-Vegas’ best and brightest to vie for his case.” Tabitha turns from her destroyed city and meanders back to her desk where she pulls an envelope from a desk drawer. She turns and hands it to you.</p>
             <p> “Inside this envelope contains all of the people who are detrimental to the election of Damien Moros. It’s paper. Virtually untraceable- unless of course you lose it. We need you to make sure they aren’t there. 
             That's the only way to restore Neo-Vegas back to even the shell of what to was. I’m not claiming that the city used to be a holy and but, it had to be better than this.” She gestures to the desolation rotting outside of the window. 
             <p>“I’m also not telling you to join us. <turn to="gameover">You can leave,</turn> but just know that there might not be a city to return to for much longer. So.” Tabitha asks. <show paragraph="Leave">"Are you with us?"</show></p>

                    <p>Daughter Euodia,</p>
                    <p>I am sorry for my absence from the church these past weeks. Tabitha has sent me to talk to the Brothers of the Isles and the Daughters of Job. They're all just as fearful as we are about the new rising that it taking place in downtown Neo-Vegas this month. With the ascension of the new chairmen everyone of the Abrahamic religions is more on edge than ever. In my meeting with the Daughters of Job they spoke of their connections with the Abu Lahab and their ranks have been dropping steadily for months now. All craving the ‘scientific release’ that Scientology will give them. I remember the stories Daughter Abel would tell us -- the ones about Abrahamic religions being powerful enough to control the government. What a sweet thought! Now we live by these rules,</p>
                    <p>Man is an immortal spiritual being.</p>
                    <p>His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.</p>
                    <p>His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.</p>
                    <p>How true those words are and how much I hate them for that truth. If I have learned anything from this life Euodia, is that man is a sick monster to those weaker than him. I myself have seen the things happening in the so called ‘safe houses’ on the strip. They are no more than the casinos that were gutted all those years ago. I can not wait to return to the safety of The Refuge and to your arms.</p>

                <p>[Except from a larger work on Neo-Vegas Religions]</p>
                 <p>The Church for the Children of Edith (CCE) is one of the newest factions to join the several Abrahamic practices since the major religions took a split in 2078 after the sudden rise of The Church of Scientology. The organisation was originally a branch of the Daughters of Job, but when Christelle Branwell became Honored Queen in 2103 she issued an armistice against the coal tycoon, Tyrell Veritch, and his company CONSOL Energy. A series of defectors formed an environmentalist movement dedicated to raise awareness of humanity's fragile balance with the Earth. One member was future CCE founder, Yutheria Retwell. </p> 
                 <p>The organizations scripture, “Dust to Dust” was in direct disagreement with Scientology’s beliefs of human immortality. The resisters fled to the city-state of Neo-Vegas where Yutheria Retwell established the Church for the Children of Edith as an institute for rehabilitating the Earth. The name came from Lot’s Wife who turned to salt after glancing back at the burning city of Sodom, according to current Eldest, Jones Mureel, it “...is a symbol that we are made from this Earth and to the Earth we shall return.”</p>

They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.  All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return” but the difference is that “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work” -- Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</p>

 <!-- CHAPTER ONE -->
        <page id="openingChapterOne">
            <p>You find yourself standing in front of a building, but building is the wrong word to describe the figure that towers before you. It is a monument of power, built on the ashes of an ancient metropolitan city. The Cosmopolitan Casino, which stretches up one hundred and four floors, has the capacity to hold close to twenty four thousand people. People around you flock to the giant black block of a building like pilgrims used to flock to Mecca. You recall the layout of the building, as told to you by Tabatha quickly as she thrust a sword into your hand. It has six pools including a daytime pool, a nighttime pool, and a relaxation pool. There is an art gallery on the fifty second floor currently featuring video screenings of classical performance artist Marina Abramovic. The lower floors contain signature attractions such as Marquee Nightclub & Dayclub. Both were part of the original Cosmopolitan Casino that was demolished in 2150. There wasn’t much there to demolish in the first place because everything was mostly burned down but that didn’t stop the contractors from rolling in and making sure that the rest of the buildings went to rubble. No stone left behind, or something like that. </p>
            <p>Despite all the amenities that the Cosmopolitan has to offer, it is most famous for selling its customers something that can’t be bought on the shelves of the Save-n-Shop that has taken over every street corner. The Cosmopolitan has managed to mass product the sale of lust. It was quite easy to do once Naomi Hall was able to liquefy hormones into injectable capsules. EM-O-TION was now one of the leading synthetic companies with stock up over 3 points in the last week alone.</p> 
            <p>But you aren’t hear for Naomi Hall and her synthetic empire. You are here for the man that lives on the top floor of this edifice. Nickolev Zakharov is the son of one of the founding members of Neo Vegas. When The Great Fire of Las Vegas destroyed 100 square miles of downtown Las Vegas Nickolev’s father Yakoev, was the main architect and technology expert to design the new strip for the city of Las Vegas. All of the pulsating electric lights, from the Margent Corp Building and the thousands of men handling the finances for Great Basin bioregion right down to the Neo-Vegas Public library and the thousands of books that reside within its glass frame came from Yakoev’s mind.</p>  
            <p>You only know the facts of your mission target. Nickolev went studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. He returned only when his father passed away and now he rules over an empire built on the image of societal beauty. He is the main benefactor of the faction going up against the man you need to be elected. But the man inside of the all black suit is a mystery to everyone else as he is to you -- someone who first heard his name four hours ago. </p>
            <p>Even though it is a cloudless night, you can just barely see the electric blue kool-aid lights from the private terraces that signifies elite presence at the <turn to="outerAtrium">cosmopolitan.</turn> </p>

			<p>You enter into the crescent par-thru of the Cosmopolitan's outer atrium. The solar roadways have been tinted black to match the façade of the building. Par-transports pull up, their sleek white exteriors hum softly as the richest citizens in step into the soft blue glow of the <turn to="InteriorA">interior</turn>.</p>
			<p>You look around a little more glancing further out, past the Cosmo grounds and into the busy street of the Neo-Vegas strip.

The marble structure almost radiates Statehood times with it’s smooth white curves and small cherubs adorning the obelisk that slowly pours out actual water. Opposite the crowded street you get a glimpse of an Oxidizer. It has been custom fitted to match the aesthetic of the building but the tell tale signs of oxygen junkies surrounding it give away it’s purpose. An invention by Great Basin native, Norman Beller no doubt. His inventions have taken the region by storm for replacing natural processes. Speaking of natural processes, you notice a very small sign tucked into the back left hand corner of the par-thru that reads, <turn to="garden">Memorial Gardens.</turn></p>

			<p>You take a seat on the smooth surface of the fountain and it immediately sends coldness up your spine that is soothing against the dry hot air.

It’s really one of the finer parts of being a mercenary, you know, you get to see so many different sides of things! The before, the during, the inevitable collapse and struggle for power.

You can no longer see the street from here as you walk deeper into the garden. The turf under you is soft, a softness that can only be produced by Fabric Herb™.

There is nothing to compare the sheer amount of wealth that accumulates inside this room, and that’s not because you have only been conscious for eighteen hours. It’s how the ceiling stretches up into a black escape, creating the illusion of infinite space inside the black box. It eats the secrets and lost coins from the tables below in a monstrous fashion. It’s how the tables themselves seem to be levitating off the ground, each game of chance pulsating a different colour, red for <show paragraph="roulette"> roulette</show>, green for <show paragraph="craps">craps</show>, and purple for poker.

             <p>In the 1920’s there were speakeasy's while the foolish government of the old America tried to cap the freedom of the American people under the claim of protecting the country from criminal activity caused by scandalous drinking. Now the people just straight up came out and said they hated the lower class and called it a good day. One might confuse the circular enclave with a tavern. Taverns were a place of business where people could do business while heightening their blood alcohol content. Unfortunately they fell out of favor when women decided that they wanted to enter without their husbands.  That’s when someone invented… the bar. A revolutionary invention that would come to kill millions of people and have no real positive influence on the human race. This was whole heartedly a bar. There were no positive influences to come from this place.</p>

Women were draped across stools or slouched over the counter, while men swallowed back ethanol, more popularly called vodka.

            Casinos are supposed to have low ceilings. That is one of the guiding foundations passed down from seedy architect to seedy architect as a way to ensnare the youthful gambler into pawning away their college education. Not that anyone who wasn’t a millionaire now could afford college, there were more people with yatchs than college educations after the war ended federal funding. The Cosmopolitan however, didn’t care for such antiquated norms and was instead adorned with ceiling that stretched skywards. Upon the ceiling ending there were neat rows of fluorescent light bulbs that were meant to simulate sunshine. They shouldn't have made them glass of course because you couldn’t control actual sunlight and there needed to be some reliability in having workers see their papers. So alas, fluorescent tubes of energy would have to simulate it. This is the first thing you notice upon ascending the onyx staircase and being spat out into the heat of the hotel. Stretching up above you are balconies of tenants. The woman in 34R was leaning over the railing to view people down below while the man in 56T sipped alcoholic beverages that would cause him to become disoriented and fall to his death in twenty six minutes.

            <p>In the year 2089 the commonly known ‘Murphy's Law, which stated that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, was rewritten by the Broadcasters Associated Conglomerate Tribune to mean that, any cooperation that can make money, will make money. They trademarked it after the New York Time printed a column about it and sued them for copyright violation.</p>
            <p>With such an inspirational move taking place others have since followed in BACT’s footsteps, but have changed their moves just enough so that they avoid lawsuits, by using new technology in ways that it should not be used. For instance, ever since the demolition of the stock market in 2109 when Yougten Ullyier and his roommate at MIT, Juirch Miller overrode the firewall and released sensitive information regarding the world's largest companies, instead of investing money into the stock market, wealthy to do people now instead bet on how the market will change and receive their winnings that way. Thus the Electronic Videomat Association (EVA)  arose out of the organization formerly known as the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which had been terminated when Nevada was itself, terminated. </p>
            <p>EVA has gone onto be the premier provider in electronic betting with over one thousand different consuls in their repertoire, from machines where players can bet on the number of lightning strikes in a Somalian rain storm, to how many casualties in the raid on Los Angeles by the Mother Militant or Parent Group (MMorPG).</p>
            <p>The Cosmopolitan offers an exclusive brand of EVA machines, which had nothing to do with the sudden and tragic accident that killed every single member of the anti-automation gang which tried to kidnap the CEO’s daughter, that appeared in late 2170. Called How the Crow Flies (some people think that it sounds more like the title of a young adult's novel but it draws in over two hundred thousand people per round so those people are largely ignored) the premise of the game has something to do with stacking and can be explored in depth in the number one bestselling novel, ‘Stacking the Game' written by Georges Tharoen. The MGM also offers a line of EVA machines, these give players the chance to gamble on the pollution particulate count in a random one inch by one inch square.

            <p>The year 2000 saw many great developments for the planet Earth such as Jessica Simpson's Edible Perfume and in the good timeline of America, the election of Al Gore as the president of the United States. However, trivial things such as the president of the United States have long been forgotten by the public in favour of much more important global changes, like the launch of the World Cyber Games and the Electronic Sports World Cup. For one hundred and seventy five years iconic games such as <i>League of Legends</i> and <i>Counter Strike:Global Offense</i> have paved the way for electronic games to get the credibility they have today. Without the players of the past, such as Soon-Yang Kim and Jin-Kung Park who founded the Korean ESport College in 2050, ESports could have never grown to the global phenomenon it is today. You stand surrounded by all the technology the future has to offer. The <turn to="InteriorC"> games of the past </turn> stand in their namesake - that is to say behind you. In the electronic lounge in the Cosmopolitan well to do people can sit and wage away money on the hopes and dreams of seventeen year old. Their skin is pulled back tight over their bones as they discuss how in their days they had to use <i>controllers</i> instead of using the PSI-Konnect that is standard today. Their smiles look more like grimaces as they see the Game of Masters team from Nairobi has overtaken the French team by six points. On table to their left is a <interact with="ebetLetter">book</interact> that has been forgotten.</p>

            <p>There are those that look for comfort in the bottom of a whiskey glass or in the bottom of an ice cream tub. Then there are those that look for comfort in the bottom of another person and it is those people that usually end up at the Marquee Nightclub at least once in their unfulfilled lives. The Marquee Nightclub, located at the base of the Cosmopolitan Casino, is a staple of high class nightlife in Neo-Vegas --  a sort of sordid homing beacon for those who crave the illusion of love and the concrete definition of lust. The people who find themselves here can foot the bill to isolate themselves from the outside world with gorgeous women, so that’s what they do. The woman here provide a temporary service for the rotting souls until they have had their revelation and discover what true love is while a Roy Martin song plays in the background while a montage consisting of walks in the park and cuddling flies before them. </p>
            <p>The woman here crave no montages.</p> 
            <p>What they do crave is money to soothe their bruised knees, which are stark against their shining egos, and fund their expensive clothing, or lack thereof, and as you walk deeper into the room you hear them making this known to one man who craved a montage moment with a girl who looks like she would be a Candi.</p>

The centerpiece in the room is a center stage adorned with Edison lightbulbs around the edge as a relic of , which draws the eyes of all who walk into the room. It seems to be a showgirl itself, greedy for attention, pleading <i>look at me.</i> The carbon filament in the lights curl around themselves again and again and again, much like the women who pull themselves onto bars with graceful ease. Everything in the room is hot, curvy, and shining.</p>
            <p>A terrifying <show paragraph="privaterooms">door</show> looms across the landscape of libido and from it calls the promise of funtimes to be had. The things that exists beyond the silicon plexiglass are never known or spoken of once the men stagger out minutes, hours, or sometimes days after they enter.

                <p>You aren’t sure what your expectations were for the office of a man who was only one step down from being a crime boss. </p>
                <p> But let you be the first to say...</p>
                <p>... this wasn’t it.</p>
                <p>You had set the scene before your eyes had even had time to render the information before them. An office full with splendor and luxury would engulf you as soon as you took place inside the glass walls that looked over a city clinging to it oxygen tank and the rick twisted the breathing tube around its neck. There would be a chandelier, made of glass, or diamonds perhaps, that would hand from the ceiling sending fractions of light that would fall on technology that hadn’t even hit the market yet. There would be plans for buildings that would be built on the homes and with the hands of the poor. There would be a red tint to the room. Symbolic of the never ending quest  for love in a lust filled place and there would be the remains of nighttime lovers strewn across the room haphazardly. You swear you could picture it before you had even seen it. </p>
                <p> What you walked in on was lifeless. There was a grey spirit that stained everything in the room a dull colour and made the glass windows shine an opaque reflection. There was no chandelier, no plans, no Ming-Dynasty vases, no hundred lefts laying around, nothing to signify that this was anything other than a rather large cubicle. What there was however, was old fashioned computer parts: desktops, monitors, keyboards, mainframes, server pieces, RAM chips, LAN cables. All were piled up on the table and spilled over onto the floor and flowed down the aisle until they met the focal point of the room.  Where you had hoped the epitome of wealth and power would stand, a man who could purchase the world twice over, was just a twenty seven year old man who stood gutting a rather large piece of hardware. A motherboard was ripped out rather viciously as you entered the room and thrown on to the pile to the left.</p>
                <p> He looks up at you. Grease is smeared slightly across his cheek. His dirty blonde hair falls in his face. He’s wearing what appears to be a black cotton shirt. He looks into your eyes and you notice that his eyes are green. He tries to step back but it seems in his haste to remove the heart of his machine his hand has gotten trapped. He does a marvelous job of covering that fact up. Fear doesn’t show on his face for even a second, but nothing can be hidden from you. </p>
                <p> “You aren’t supposed to be here.” Well, at least he’s observant. “But since you seem to be both smart and desperate enough to gain access is there something I might help you with?” This question takes you aback. Out of all the things you had calculated to come out his mouth, those were at least  #1345 on the list. He takes action in your moments hesitation to palm a throwing knife and throw it directly at you…</p>
                <p>DO YOU STRAY <turn to="leftAndRight">LEFT</turn> OR <turn to="leftAndRight">RIGHT</turn>?</p>

                <p> You are quite impressed with his throwing skills. The knife soars through the air -- directly towards your glabella. You are quicker though and strafe just in time to dodge the impact thrown in your direction. So that’s how it’s going to be? If he doesn’t want to play by the rules neither will you. The bartender was right. Everything about this man is cold. You run towards him jumping up and sliding across the conference table that he has step up workshop on. Pieces of machinery fall to the floor sending out noises that seem to deafen your ears. In one quick movement you grab the arm that has become trapped in the cyber world and rip it from the computer. As you do so Nickolvev lets out a scream of pain as a sudden, but not unexpected, wetness coats your fingers. You shove your fingers deep into the laceration that travels down the man’s forearm making him wince, but not scream. Before he can get a single defence move in your sword has cut through his major tendons and he falls to the ground.  You imagine him to be the man in your preconceived vision as you slide your sword into his stomach. It helps the metal slide between his ribs a little bit easier. </p>
                <p>He’s unable to move -- equal parts because of pain and because he simply can’t.</p>
                <p>You wait for fifteen minutes watching him regurgitate up his own blood. You don’t get to see his last breath however as a sudden movement outside the window alerts you to the fact the you will soon be not alone.</p>
                <p> You decide to take your <turn to="levelone">LEAVE</turn> knowing your job is done and your promise to the bartender fulfilled.</p>

                <p>You lose all sense of left and right and instead just hit the floor.</p>

                <p>Twice.</p> 
                <p>They don’t flicked a third time because everything goes dark as the power fades from the Cosmopolitan building. </p>
                <p> You hear screaming from the direction you take to be downstairs.</p>
                <p><i>“Nobody move or you will be shot!”</i></p>

                <p>The last noise is a the firing of an automatic gun.</p>
                <p> The lights come on and Nickolev is nowhere to be seen. In his place is a note that reads, “<i> Thanks for those codes. No money. No Nickolev. No problems.”</i></p>

                <p>When Yakoev Zakharov constructed such a vault as the Cosmopolitan Casino the man hired thirty three design engineers to examine thirteen of the wealthiest casinos worldwide and calculate their total casino win, slot win, number of slots, slot occupancy rate, player count, and the ratio of players to rooms. Out of this came the five principles that can be found in <i> The Design Comprehension for Laying Odds Hotel and Casino Manual </i> which was published by Yakoev Zakharov himself.  </p>
                <p>First, gambling equipment should be immediately inside the casino entrance instead of a vacant lobby.</p>
                <p>Second, the maze layout is more effective than long straight aisles.</p>
                <p>Third, gambling equipment needs to be as memorable and impressive as the decor.</p>
                <p>Fourth, pathways need to emphasize the gambling equipment.</p>
                <p>Fifth, standard decor beats elaborative themes.</p>
                <p>These principles have allowed the Cosmopolitan Casino to become on of the top ten ranking casinos worldwide. </p>

                <p>The late 2070’s saw one of the most ethical dilemmas the sports community has ever faced. With the constant growth of stronger athletes the steroid market produced Eir, a non traceable short lasting steroid which would increase the user's overall muscle capacity for the duration of ninety six minutes. Athletic associations around the world started using the drug for better performance since the FDA’s 2076 lab findings reported no adverse effects. Athletic sports became significantly more brutal….with injuries in soccer increasing by 67%..... and in American football by 304%....However, the NASC saw an increase of 84% in viewer ship and decided to keep Eir in place.  In response the NASC discarded all restrictions of testosterone enhancing or booster materials. The Athletic Association of America, which has been disbanded since, created the American Gaming Commission in order to create a new line of family friendly sports.</p>

                <p>Yakoev Zarkharov was not only responsible for the restoration of the greater Neo-Vegas area. He was also a respected veteran in the Greater North America Militant Siege, where he served as a technological advisor to the States. When the United States government was disbanded after the defeat of the Militants by the States, Yakoev was appointed to serve as a technological strategist on the North American Development Committee of Ecoregions. Yakoev spent three years in Laurentia where he met his wife Sletvana. After the implementation of bioregional government over the destroyed United States and Canada, Yakoev moved to Great Basin where he had his first and only child, Nickolev. Sletvana passed away in childbirth due to a reaction to the drug Lempthphorin. Yakoev continued to be a beacon of advancement as he continued to build the Cosmopolitan in wake of the tragedy. He leaves behind a legacy of innovation in the face of destruction and perseverance when no hope was seen.  May the Cosmopolitan Casino before you stand as a mausoleum to an irreplaceable architect.</p>

I got a key for the main elevator in the Marquee Nightclub. It leads straight up to Zakharov’s office in the restricted upper levels. I’ll give it to you, you just have to promise me something.” He looks around again and you get the feeling he might be slightly nervous. “You promise to shove your sword so deep in his gut his organs get rearranged.” You think that is a very gruesome metaphor. He seems to sense your hesitation.</p>
                        <p>“Listen, if you’re sent by the sisterhood you aren’t from around here. Zakharov’s got more dead bodies on him than years on this damn planet. You name it, he’s done it. You think a place like this can be built on clean money?” He does not ask this question for the purpose of having it answered. It’s called a rhetorical question and people use them when they don't want to make statements because they might be wrong. “The people who managed to buy power here, now use everyone below them to make sure it stays that way. I saw my perfectly healthy parents get hauled off in a quarantine vehicle by Zakharov’s men. Whatever he’s doing, he ain’t doing it for the lower class.

You see I’m interested in keeping Mr. Zakharov very much alive, for reasons of my own.” The technicolor lights which flicker around sporadically seem wildly out of place for the conversation you seem to be wading into. You sit in an aura of harmless fun whilst debating whether someone deserves to live. You have never felt more like a capitalist. “I’m in the business of making people disappear and I have a client very interested in making sure that the Cosmopolitan goes dark along with Zarkharov himself. Now, I have a way to do this, I just need some door codes which are kept in offices behind the front desk. You get me these codes and then just knock him out and I'll take care off the rest.

<!-- CHAPTER TWO -->
         <page id="levelone">
            <p>The Stratosphere Casino was the only triple A casino not located on the strip, however by not being located on the strip, it is the only casino within the actual city limits of Las Vegas. Notice the use to the past tense. During the fire of Las Vegas, the casino portion of what made up the Stratosphere Casino and Tower was transformed into what many refer to as a pile of hot nothing. The valley of ash formally known as the Stratosphere Casino sits under a complex of shopping centers called Mallvetica, as most of the funds came from the great-great-great-great granddaughter of Max Miedinger, the creator of the sweatpant font. </p>
            <p>The 1,129 foot tall tower however, was unfazed by the burning inferno that raged beneath it on that July night because after all <i> rocket fuel can’t burn steel beams. </i> </p>
            <p>Therefore the reinforced glass observatory that sits atop the tower managed to struggle through a fire, corporations, capitalistic greed and remain standing despite all gentrification odds. Even though it doesn't tower over the city anymore, it serves as a relic (and a bit of a reminder) of good times and years passed.</p>
            <p>Which is why it was given to the only person who could smear nostalgia in the dust.</p>
            <p>The woman in white was a legend; both because she was an academic genius and because many believed she didn’t exists. In a society where most are connected through a series of glass filament tubes shooting electrons that contain information, it was much easier to say that people who were very smarter than you were simply created by a group of people slightly smarter than you. This made people feel better about their own failed life goals and expectations. The woman in white was however, very really and therefore, a very large threat. </p>
            <p> Tabitha hadn’t given you much information about the woman in white, which could not be more evident by the fact you are referring to her as <i>the woman in white </i>. The name came from the entirely white attire she donned whenever she pried herself from the laboratory fashioned out of the observatory that now stood before you. From the white lab coat, to the high Victorian collar, right down to the velcro boots only someone with six doctorates could pull off. </p>
            <p> You are able to enter into the the base of the tower and ascend in the elevator with little difficulty. With the election a day closer, the higher citizens of the state have been flinging themselves into campaigns and the city has been quieter in person and exploding on the internet. The elevator drops you at the bottom of the observation deck and you step out into the <turn to="ReceptionArea">reception area</turn> to look for a way to get to the top floor.</p>
        </page>  
        <page id="ReceptionArea">
                <p>Reception desks. They have plagued the social anxious for decades. Not even the year 2175, with its high tech cakes and removal of library books, can stop the anxiety that arises in the pit of the stomachs of those who dread talking to other members of society.  For better or for worse, you haven’t decided, the lobby of Stratosphere Laboratories is empty. Completely, totally, and one hundred percent devoid of life. It’s a lifeless place in itself; after all, there are dead bodies sitting.. mmmmmm… twenty feet away from you fermenting in their own rotting atmosphere. </p>
                <p>The <interact with="DeskWIW">desk</interact> is organized in a sterile fashion that complements the pasty walls and white floor in a way no interior decoration ever could. The only thing that seems to be out of place is a single piece of <interact with="DeskNoteWIW"> paper</interact> that has the seams of crinkles running throughout it even though someone has obviously tried to flatten it out. Past the reception desk is a <turn to="HallwayWIW">hallway</turn> that seems to spread only deeper into the building. </p>

        <page id="HallwayWIW">
            The hallway is lit with fluorescent tubes called LED light bulbs. They were accidently invented in 1962 after some man just wanted to invent a laser. The man who owned incandescent light bulbs, aka the lightbulbs that were about to be replaced, felt a little peeved by this new and improved product and called it “the magic one”. Back in those days everything that wasn’t accepted by large corporations was damned and called ‘black magic’. Now, of course, corporations just steal their ideas and profit off of them. Underneath the black magic lightbulbs is a plain white <turn to="SupplyRoom">door</turn> that has the letter S-U-P-P-L-Y written across it. Therefore, you concur that it must be a supply closet. Directly across from the supply closet is a non descript <show paragraph="BoilerRoom">door</show>; all the doors are non descript as the woman in white doesn’t believe in signs, but this one is particularly bland. Further down the hallway is a sharp right <turn to ="BodyHolding">turn</turn> and from it wafts the terrible acidic stench of acids and flesh. Just before the turn seems to be a pair of pried open pair of silver <turn to="ElevatorOne">doors</turn>. The <turn to="ReceptionArea">lobby</turn> lurks behind you.

            <p>A snort of laughter follows.</p>

            You follow the stench of formaldehyde and decaying organic material, leaving behind the <turn to="HallwayWIW">hallway</turn>,  and enter into a long corridor room lined with black bags. Casements line the great corridor that stretched from only millimeters off the floor to unreachable heights and the thought of how those can even be used passes through your head. There is a large black sign painted on the floor in what seems to be futura. Futura is a font that used to be used by some people called the Nazi’s and was quite unpopular until another group of people, called astronauts, started to use it when they wanted some cool looking moon rocks. Both Nazi’s and astronauts hated the Russians. The large black signs says <show paragraph="Autopsy">autopsy</show> and points directly ahead of you.

            You cross the room, minding the precarious assembly of those passed on, and enter through the doorway. Passed the doorway is only a small room, matched in interior decor to the last. CyberTek computers are mounted on the south east wall, each displaying the national emblem of the Greater Plateau area. It spins and spins and spins around seeming to want your attention in the midst of a geopolitical crisis. Next to the congregation of computers is a <interact with="powerBox">power box.</interact>

If Tabitha has told you correctly, this elevator should take you up the laboratory and into the upper offices where the woman in white works. Tabitha had said ‘lives’ but you gather that since her work is her life (she doesn’t have much of a home life to speak of.) The elevator doors are pried open with a metal bar of sorts and from the cranny a cold wind gusts up and washes around your feet.  There are tools precariously balanced on the edge of the elevator shaft as well.

Like the floors below you, and most likely like the floors above you, the laboratory that lounges in front of you is nothing but a white sterile landscape that seems to hold a plethora of scientific data. You feel like a test subject stepping into a test tube to be combined with Hydrochloric Acid and mention in an obscure medical paper. As you step out, probably contaminating the room with your less than sterile attire, you take in the four sections of the room. In the far right hand corner seems to be a durasteel door holding the entrance to a <turn to="vault">Black Box Room TM</turn> closed.

There, in the minutes of an university honoring a dead geographical location, on April 1955 in the meeting of the Tech Model Railroad Club states, “Mr. Eccles requests anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn these power off to avoid blowing a fuse.” The term ‘hacker’ was used by computer enthusiast to describe computer programs.

                <p>Serum #164 has yielded positive results in creating stagnant activity in patients neurological synapses. The TCA scan of 22 January 2175 results in the decrease of 10 billion neurons in the brain causing the patient to result to ‘muscle memory’ activities only.

        <!-- Floor Three -->  
            <page id="floorThreeWIW">
                <p> As soon as the elevator arrives at the third floor a terrible stench floats from the previously closed off section and into the elevator, an elevator which seems to have stopped once again. This time just one floor short your intended target. You try not to see a morbid metaphor in that. You manage to push yourself out of the broken container and into the sickening mist of formaldehyde that leisurely drapes itself across the room. Said room that you have just entered, is the black sheep of Stratosphere Laboratories.  If the other floors were the perfect children this would be the one that depression went undiagnosed and now sell cocaine for a living. Depression is a disease that is called when the bad chemicals in your brain start working too much. Cocaine is a white powdery substance that looks like powdered sugar; both can make people addicted to it. The first thing brought to your attention is just how dark this room is compared to the others. While the lower levels where almost blindingly lit with flourescent lightbulbs, level three seems to being more partial to having what 20th century teenagers called a <i>rave</i>. The illumination that was supposed to be coming from the ceiling now seemed to expresses itself from all around as the lights seemed insistent on having a strobe effect.</p>
                <p>You take a step further out, and as you do so your foot lands in a sticky substance that coats the bottom of your boot. You cast your attention downwards and see that you are standing in a thin pool of liquid. As you take another, more careful, step forward you see the ripples shatter throughout the floor and continue on until the hit the far wall before boomeranging back to you. </p> 
                <p>Fat coils of wire drape from the ceiling, all haphazardly pulled out of the tiles, making a cascading river of electrons  that cut canyons down the walls. They all seem to flow to four separate… four individual… four circular…. tanks? Your brain only seems to recognize the cylindrical objects that dominate the majority of the putrid room as over sized fish tanks. A gelatinous fluid sloshes around, being propelled by something that is coming out of the plethora of wires that sucker themselves to the bottom of each tank. The image could be compared to that of a synthetic octopus, if there were any octopuses left for it to be compared to that is. </p>
                </p> Through the inconsistent illumination of the room, you can make out the bold label numbering off the four containers according the the western Arabic numeral system.</p>
                <p>The first one reads <turn to="tankOne">TANK ONE.</turn></p>
                <p>The second one reads <turn to="tankTwo">TANK TWO.</turn></p>
                <p>The third one reads <turn to="tankThree">TANK THREE.</turn></p>
                <p>The fourth one read <turn to="tankFour">NK FO.</turn></p>

            <page id="tankOne">
                <p>You step away from the <turn to="floorThreeWIW">main floor</turn> to examine the first tank. The first tank seems to empty, drained of both experiments and the putrid jelly that seems to be coating the floor in a news type of carpet that should never have been invented. Another thing that should never have been invented, Red Dye No. 2. Don’t know why, but everyone seems to hate it. You circle the tank looking for signs that might lead you to understanding the decomposing scene before you, Your hunt ends you to finding one of the lab assistants, or what you assume to be a lab assistant, in this economy, you never know. He is slouched against the tank, breathing still, most likely just passed out due to the horrid stench that even now makes you queasy, his body congealing in the thick liquid. Clutched in his hand is a piece of <interact with="letterTwoWIW">paper</interact>.</p>
            </page>
            <page id="tankTwo">
                The second tank seems to have a series of… abstract figures preserved in the formaldehyde that slowly churns within. As the blades of air spin the mixture around, a severed hand pass you by, waving through the window. You tear your eyes away from it as it passes around to the other side of the tank and look down to see a <interact with="tankTwoBody">body</interact> curled up around the base of the tank. You freeze as you realize they are conscious, but just barely. The only motor function they seem capable of is muttering incoherently to themselves. You feel uneasy an would like to <turn to="floorThreeWIW">leave</turn> now.

            <page id="tankThree">
                The third tank seems to be the oldest of the two. The plexiglass is now tainted with scratches and spiderweb fractures and the formaldehyde inside looks as if to have reached new levels of fermentation. The usually clear   liquid has become a terrible red colour that can obscure your vision to the other side, but just isn't dark enough to hide the human shaped figure inside. A study conducted in 2089 revealed that the human silhouette dropped thirteen slots in the most recognizable figure after John Risch developed Bamme, a corporation dedicated to changing the human form to the mind’s whim. Bamme is currently grossing three trillion teros per quarter and performing three thousand operations per day.

                <p>If one were to visit www.thesaurus.com/browse/destoryed they would find thirty synonyms for the word destroyed. The most similar synonym listed is broken while wiped out is the least. If one were to visit www.dictionary.com/browse/destroyed they would find that the origin of the word destroyed cones from the Middle English word ‘destroyen’ which comes from the Old French word ‘desturire,’ which comes from the Vulgar Latin word ‘destrugere’, which comes from the Basic Latin word destruere; which means “to pick up, build”.  Ironic how that works. Yet, despite all of the synonyms listed on www.thesaurus.com/browse/destoryed, there fails to be one that can describe the type of destruction that has taken place here.

Floor two makes that look like freaking Buckingham Palace. Something happened to one of the tanks and now the Shifta gel is everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Some of it even got into the circuit room and now the power is wiggin’ out. I think we can kill two jobs with one switch if we re-route the power from the ceiling coils to the electrical grid in the floor. The heat should evaporate some of that Shifa and the power should be working fine. Just throw the left switch in the circuit room and make sure no one’s on the floor when you do it? Formaldehyde might be a bad smell but I’m sure charred flesh is worse. </p>

                <p>The building that once held so much life and gambling is now a white, sterile, medical facility at it’s heart. The woman in white stands against the wall of windows that encompasses the laboratory, a coal black backdrop framing her silhouette against the city skyline. Printed over the windows, in letters that not even the blind could miss are the words.</p>

The woman who towers over Neo-Vegas, both figuratively - and now quite literally, must be aware of your presence by now; for as you cross the circular room you are doing nothing to block the sound wave that echo from your feet and the woman before you is not hard of hearing. Her eyes register the sound waves that are pushed from the floor, those vibrations are converted into messages in the brain which fire synapses that alerted her to your presence.</p>

Whom am I but one more body to hit the floor? My life counts as no more than the guards downstairs.” She turns back to face the window now. A new, sudden, disposition about her. “We had the chance to push humanity forward from the ashes of complete and utter failure. I was prepared to do what needed to be done to make that happen, it is none of my concern that others weren’t. The fact of the matter is sometimes the uncivilized things have to go.</p>

People are living longer, being healthier, the global poverty rate is declining, child mortality is at an all time low, the planet has stopped heating, and for Cruise’s sake people are richer now than they have ever been.

Your claim about the woman in white being hard of hearing is surely false now. The glass windows that surround the laboratory shatter inward, firing glass bullets into the room. Your eyes water from the pain of it all but you manage to keep yourself upright and look the woman dead in the eye. “And I am forth and willing to die as well.” And with no more words, the wind reaches up from the skyline below and grabs her pulling her towards the sidewalk.

                        <p>You don’t think anyone has actually successfully tried to, you know, kill the woman in white. As you lunge at her from across the room her face morphs first into an expression of surprise that quickly fades into fear as you pull out the small syringe of <i>forget-me-not</i> serum from where you had hidden it. Her words, <i> a fate worse than death </i> still fresh in your mind. In one foul swoop, you rip off the safety cap and very unsafely inject it into her neck. However, instead of the usual convulsions that should accompany the ‘forget-me-not’ serum blood seems to start spurting from every possible orifice. It’s a bloodbath. Children are crying. A fire randomly starts somewhere. People are screaming. You look down at the syringe in your hand and see you accidentally grabbed one of the untested serums.When you look up the woman in white has become the woman in red.</p>
                        <p>She’s also dead on the floor.</p>

<!-- CHAPTER THREE -->
        <page id="chapterThree">
            <p>Jeanette Deniz was a descendant of the gangsters in the Old-Vegas. After the terrible drought that came across the desert of Nevada, Las Vegas had become a desolate and rotting city. A great firestorm swept over the rotting corpse of the city and wiped it clean with one breath of inferno. Jeanette’s family inheritance burned down alongside Caesar's Palace casino as for the second time Rome fell. They were forced to waste away among the  poor in the rotten blood district. In case the name does not inform you, the rotten blood district is not a pleasant place to live. The buildings are built on the landfill where all the bodies were dumped after the great fire which unfortunately, causes some serious structural integrity. This week along three buildings will concave trapping sixteen people inside the rubble, never to be saved. Their cries will so silent into the bustling night as only a thousand feet away a woman will throw away an entire roasted duck because he ex-boyfriend looked at it. </p>
            <p> Then at just twenty-two years of age, Jeanette Deniz was appointed by Chairwoman Isobel to lead the National Heritage Foundation of the Greater Neo-Vegas area, and with one flick of the pen, the Deniz family was whisked out of destitute and back into the silver spoon district. It also meant they had sworn their allegiance to the Kythreal family, no matter the cost, and no matter the price. Just like her name, her house was old fashioned. Jeanette, who was as foreign to the high collared Neo-Vegas scene as you were, seemed to build her facade of wealth on her family tree; nailing oil paintings into its bark and hanging antique vases from its branches. </p>
            <p> The building serves as the colosseum and you a gladiator as you enter through the double doors and into the stone cold interior. However, instead of rushing into battle, sword draw and teeth gnashing, you walk with leisure to your pace. Yoou sword is sheathed. You are here by instruction of Tabitha with an invitation she snatched, only Tom Cruise knows how. Therefore you keep your blood lust at bay and try to think of an incognito way to dispose of Jeanette Deniz.</p>

            <p>You return to the grand entryway - unsuccessful in your quest to find the hostess of the party. It seems that not showing up to your own fundraising party would be a social faux-pas that not even Jeanette Deniz would attempt. Therefore, you enter into the fountain center with a new determination in your uncontrollable mind. </p>
            <p>As you enter, a commotion seems to erupt from the far side of the room. The grand front door swing open and even though the mansion seemed to be sparsely populated before, a new hoard of people swarm from seemingly nowhere to flock the new members of attendance. Over all of the commotion you hear one voice rise over the crowd,</p>
            <p><i> “No, thank you, for your support.”</i></p>
            <p><i> “I assure you, I will make sure that never happens again.”</i></p>
            <p><i> “Me too! It was probably the most stressful two minutes of my life.”</i></p>
            <p><i> “I’m shocked a fight didn’t break out!”</i></p>
            <p>It’s the same voice you have heard over the speakers of billboard that flash visuals across the already blinding landscape of downtown Neo-Vegas.</p>
            <p><i> “Let Isobel live on. Lobby for Damian Kytheal.”</i></p>
            <p><i> “A supported of Damian Kytheal is a supporter of Neo-Vegas!” </i></p>
            <p>Damian Kytheal, the legendary younger brother of the deceased chairwoman, Isobel, has just walked through the door, accompanied by no other than the missing woman of the hour, Jeanette. The aforementioned woman steps forward and addresses her audience of people.</p>
            <p> “Thank you. Thank you.” She begins. What she is thanking the mindless mass of people for. you haven’t the slightest. “I would like to first and foremost apologize to each and everyone of you. My absence her today was no doubt noticed, as evident by each of your intelligence if not by my Twitter newsfeed.” This earned a few laughs. “But, there are certain special circumstances that have arisen which called for my attention. As many of you probably know, something has just happened that will change the course of Neo-Vegas history - hopefully for the better.” This got another round of laughter from the audience. Why they are laughing, you don’t know why. “Damian Kytheal, one of my closest friends, who has seen too much of this world for one of his age, has just been confirmed for inauguration to be the next chairperson of the Greater Neo-Vegas area.” The room erupts into polite rich people clapping but all you hear is an incomprehensible silence. Suddenly, someone grabs your arm. </p>
            <p>“We’re not too late.” The woman whispers into your ear. “We need to act, <i>now.</i>” You get a look at her face and recall her figure crouched over a series of sapling trees. That seems like <i>months</i> ago. Before you can reminisce any more of your assassin journey, the woman speaks again. “Tabitha dropped me a direct line and says that if you can somehow make Damian… disappear… before the word gets out in the morning, than it will look like he abandoned his post AND the city.” She turns back to face you, “You better get to it.” She points to where you see Damians dark form slink up the north east staircase. “There he goes. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you what to do further.”</p>

           <p> There is something about white people and the wasting of water. While technology has fixed many things such as: bad chemicals in one’s brain that makes people see things that aren’t actually there, (but only if you’re rich enough -- capitalism will be pried from the cold dead radioactive wasteland of the Earth) the curiosity about space (turns out everything was just an elaborate hoax by NASA to encourage wonder among humans), but it seems among all of the new innovation someone forgot to mention the water shortage. Therefore Nestle continued to cut off water sources and government continue to stick pipelines through Native American land (until there were no Native Americans left, they we all killed in the Great Shoshone Massacre of 2090)  and water became an elite commodity.. . even though it was a necessary one.</p>
            <p>Therefore there was no greater display of <i>I’m so fucking rich, Karen</i> than sticking a giant fountain in the middle of your giant marble mansion in the middle of a giant desert. Therefore that’s just what Jeanette Deniz did. The pure water, straight from the the water cycle itself, none of this bonding oxygen and hydrogen together, that was peasants water, gurgled happily from where it was pumped from some recyclable vat deep beneath the stone cold floors. For a mansion based on a Roman the decor was very… Grecian. Tall pillars rose from the corners, spiralling towards a dome ceiling which was painted with delicate figures of  deities of years past. If not for the historical context of angels and cherubs, and if not for the money that ran through the veins of every member of this party you have no doubt they would be socially ostracised for even breathing in the direction of a Christian figure.</p> 
            <p>You look around, wondering where you might find the hostess herself. You had entered from the front entrance leaving you facing a room with two doors, one leading <turn to="poolJean">east</turn> the other <turn to="kitchenJean">west</turn>. Then, pasted the fountain of wealth, there were two staircases, one going <turn to="upperLevelSouth">right</turn> and one <turn to="upperLevelNorth">left</turn>, that spiralled up to a mezzanine second floor. You could hear the murmurs of those above you, no doubt talking about the events of the past few nights. </p>

            <p>You have seen two pools so far in your time in Neo-Vegas. The first, belonging to a cryptic crime boss, the second belonging to a woman who seemed to tower over a city that was failing to build her back up in turn. So far you are seeing a high correlation between troubled trillionaires and owning a pool. Maybe all Tabitha had to do was convince Damian to buy a pool, then he would just fail his way out of being Chairman of the Greater Neo-Vegas Area. But truly, you have describe the pool inaccurately - for you see, there is not just one pool, oh no, that would be child's play, but sixteen countable pools. All flow in and out of each other creating an impossible chain. Some drip down slowly while other cascade white water into the largest, making a foamy broth and spills over into a short jellybean shaped one.

            People love to use the past to justify wrongs in the present. The future is no different. While the year 2175 has come and will soon be gone just like all the years that have fell to make it possible to breathe, the humans that walk the Earth say, <i> “This is the twenty second century! Transphobia doesn’t exist anymore! What do you think this is? 2075?”</i>And while certain exponential growths have come about, such as the election of Elizabeth Warren in 2020 proved that the people of the United States had finally grown a conscious, there are certain irrevocable sexists truths that still live unnoticed in the subconscious of people who now walk around with cybernetic implants. One that still lives on before your eyes is a kitchen full of woman. Many had hoped that the barefoot in the kitchen meme would have burned in the fires of Las Vegas, but like any great plague it survives among the festering flesh of those who survive the wreckage. For Jeanette had fired her long time cook in favour of hiring an all female kitchen staff in order to meet certain social requirements. The only way is <turn to="fountianCenter">back</turn>.

From the paper strewn across the massive desk that stand opposite you, to the charts - literal paper charts, because apparently Jeanette hasn’t heard of holographics yet - tacked up across the walls like some vintage virtual video the room seems bursting to inform you that <i> shit gets done here</i>. As if people couldn’t already tell from the countless speeches that the primary user of this room gives. So many that Jeanette Deniz has become a household name, not only for wealth and prosperity but also for commencement speeches, high profile weddings, rallies for the people, the Oscars or the Darensens, or sometimes just to random people on the street she deems worthy of hearing her words.

            <p>The word ‘living room’ was coined in the nineteenth century after semi-rich people got jealous of really rich people for having rooms adjacent to their bedrooms which served no other purpose than for their rich people buddies to come and talk about whatever rich people talk about.</p>

The walls are barren, save for a table with a deplorable holophoto of the late Bellthyran Halvard, but music sits in the air of the hallway and never ceases to alert you to it’s presence. It’s seems to be produced from the walls itself as it pulsates toward you from all directions.

            <p> You slink into the study behind Damian, just at the door closes you pull yourself into the room. He faces away from you and as the door clicks it seems a string is cut from the man’s shoulders and they hunch in on themselves as his souls seems to concave in. </p>
            <p> You step forward. </p>

            <p>Suddenly the study shifts before your eyes, like if you had discovered colour when previously you had seen nothing but black and white. It sent a sensation over your body as if you were putting on dirty clothes after taking a nice hot shower. To say in bricklayers terms -- it felt nasty. You did not enjoy it. </p>
            <p> The study is all at once exactly the same and completely different. You are alone now, Damian seemingly to have disappeared before your eyes and in his place stands a forlorned looked woman who sits leaning back in a chair, precariously you might add. Her face is the stark look of someone who doesn’t care if they live or die.</p>
            <p> “Okay Google.” The woman says. “Start new letter.”</p>
            <p><i> “Starting new letter.” </i> The voice responds. </p>
            <p> The woman sighs. “Twenty-third, November twenty-one seventy. I have been examined by thirty-six medical professionals as of this afternoon. Each one giving me a different cause for my deterioration of health. Their suggestions range from radioactive poisoning to tuberculosis. The latter much more possible than the former in this economy. “ There is a beat. “I have yet to tell anyone of my condition. I feel no guilt except for my siblings. Damian will recover I am sure, but little sist-” Her word are caught by a cough that erupt from her lungs. They are strangled in her throat as you see them swell up inside her trachea, cutting off all oxygen. Blood, instead, spills out from her mouth and clots onto the desk in oozing lumps that seems to walk off the wooden surface and hop to the floor. In exactly thirty two seconds and twelve millisecond she slumps face forward into the red mass and ceases to breath.</p>
             <p>She is however, not dead yet. One is not pronounced dead until resuscitation has been performed. Therefore, she  is not pronounced dead until twenty six minutes and eleven seconds later when Jeanette Deniz, Katharane Dexter, and Nickolev Zakharov enter (or should you say entered as it seems they are all alive and well and seemingly seven years younger by your estimation) and attempt to before a crude version of CPR. And It isn’t until, Hampton Frazier, Darus Harper, and Jedus Atticus enter do they stop. For when the later trio proclaims the aforementioned murderers everything really starts to go downhill from there. With the woman left lying in a pool of her own blood the six begin a mad rush of slander.  </p>

            <p>You enter into the dining room, which is all at once the same dining room you had previously seen and nothing like it at all. A simple round table sits center with three people you recognize to be Hampton Frazier, Darus Harper, and Jedus Atticus, the owners of the MGM Grand and the champions of the current radical movement you’re vying for. </p>
            <p> Frazier speaks first, “Listen, don’t pretend that this isn’t what we wanted.” </p>
            <p> “What do you mean?” Atticus says slowly looking to the other man. 
            <p> “Come on. Wasn’t it you who was just talking about how some twenty year old shouldn’t be in charge?” Frazier questions him. </p>
            <p> “I was talking about Nick and Katharane! Not about plotting treason!” </p>
            <p> “It’s not treason if we didn’t actually kill her.” Harper speaks up for the first time. “Who’s Katharane?” </p>
            <p> “The Regional Consultant for the Great Neo-Vegas Area on Science and Engineering.” Frazier responds. “Where have you been for the past six years?”</p>
            <p> “I didn’t even know she had a name.”Harper laments. </p>
            <p> “Anyway,” Frazier continues, “if there was ever a time to move into power it’s now. We need to make sure that Nick, Jean, and Katharance take the fall for this. Then we can restore Vegas to at least a fraction of its former potential - before all these damn snowflakes came in.” </p>

            <p> The next room you enter into is the library. Except the shelves seem to be stocked with an array of eclectic books. From your view you can piece together an off brand copy of Les Mis, a Japanese knock off of A Tale of Two Cities, and a LGBT version of the Great Gatsby. Even though the loyalist trio is standing around the small room, there seems to be more distance between them than ever before.</p>
            <p> “They are going to frame us for murder. The murder of a public figure, the murder of a public figure, the murder of our friend for Cruise’s sake! So no, I am not going to ‘calm down’ Nickolev.” Jeanette exclaims from her seat by a glass globe of the world.</p>
            <p> “Jean, all I am saying is that there is nothing people do better than take a rumor and talk. Trust me, I know.” There seems to be a glance that conveys more words to that sentence between the two. “So yes, we need to move quickly but we can’t be stupid about it.” </p>
            <p> “We need to move to disband the cabinet.” The woman in white, dressed in regular clothes, says from where she leans against a case of books pensively staring at the floor. </p>
            <p> “What?” Jeanette whispers. </p>
            <p> “Yeah, because that would make us look innocent.” Nickolev remarks.”</p>
            <p> “It’s not supposed to make us look innocent. It’s supposed to save us from being killed. Or would you rather have your husband in charge of two trillion keplos and a casino empire?” She takes a breath. “I don’t even want to know how many people will die with those three in charge - with their talk of ‘social order’ and ‘the class system’ and ‘reverting back to the good christian ways’. Sometimes we have to so things the hard way because they are the right way.”</p>

            <p> “This is fantastic.” Harper says, breaking the silence. </p>
            <p> “I do not appreciate your use of sarcasm in a moment like this.” Frazier snaps. “They didn’t even take control of the city for themselves! No! They just fucked all of us over!” He yells out to no one in particular. </p>
            <p> “What happened?” Atticus says, picking his head off of the table. </p>
            <p> Frazier answers, “Those <i>kids</i> just disbanded the cabinet. “So essentially there is no government.”</p>
            <p> “Oh there is still a government.” Harper corrects. “The library is still going freaking strong.” </p>
            <p> “So… What now?” Atticus asks, looking around as if the air contains more words he could use. “They can’t install a new cabinet unless things get to states of emergency level.”</p>
            <p> “Then we just have to make things bad enough to declare a state of emergency.” Frazier responds.</p>
            <p> Harper gives him a concerning look, ‘What do you mean?”</p>
            <p> “Come on,” Frazier says to his cohort, “it’s not like we have room to have any conscious here! If you want to overthrow the government you got to leave your personal beliefs at the door!” </p>
            <p> Harper is silent for a while, but then speaks quietly. “If we are to do this, we ourselves can’t be part of it at all. I know a group though who would align themselves with our cause.” He stops again for a moment. “And if need be, they can take the fall for this adventure.”</p>
            <p> Fraizer nods, “Very well. Go talk to this group. What’s their name?” </p>

                The major benefactor for the state is gone. Nickolev Zakharov is lost to somewhere to the hazy distance that spreads itself in a promiscuous fashion along the outskirts of Neo-Vegas. Seven hundred thousand people used to live in this great city at the beginning of the week and as that number dropped to sixty hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it changed more than a sudden mass exodus. But somewhere, out there in the great unknown, as the population of Neo-Vegas dropped - the number of people who lived happier lives increased.

                The major benefactor for the state is gone. Nickolev Zakharov is lost to somewhere to the hazy distance that spreads itself in a promiscuous fashion along the outskirts of Neo-Vegas. Seven hundred thousand people used to live in this great city at the beginning of the week and as that number dropped to sixty hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it changed more than a sudden mass exodus. But somewhere, out there in the great unknown, as the population of Neo-Vegas dropped - the number of people who lived happier lives increased.

                <p>The intellectual think tank for the state is gone as well. Katharane Baxter is dead to this Earth. If you were a more dramatic person you would say she has been purged from this Earth, but no one is truly purged from this Earth until intergalactic space travel is invented. You’ll have to remind NASA to get on that -- that is when NASA is re-established.  If  people have to die for the sake of progress, then the inverse must be true. </p>
                <p>Either way, thus ends the interregnum. </p>

                <p>The intellectual think tank of the state is gone as well. Oh Katharane Baxter still breathes, and walks, and talks, and smiles, she remembers nothing of the past. It seems that she has been wiped clean, as you once were. She, however, will not fall into the wrong hands. You send all that knew her to her side so that she may look into their face and synapses can fire old memories back into  her reach. It proves difficult, as people seem only to know <i>of</i> her. </i> Soon new inventions will roll out into the hand of Vegeons and there will be flying cars, and jetpack backpacks, and cool pools that defy the laws of gravity. Everything will become tinted blue and white like in every single futuristic movie as every citizen gets good dental care. Or they won’t. You can’t see the future. </p>
                <p>Either way, thus ends the interregnum. </p>
